1
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,370
<i>Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.</i>

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>

3
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,808
<i>these were the forces
that ruled our world.</i>

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,970
<i>A world where prey
were scared of predators.</i>

5
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,569
<i>And predators had an uncontrollable...</i>

6
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,210
<i>biological urge...</i>

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,886
<i>to maim, and maul, and...</i>

8
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,527
Blood! Blood! Blood!

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,728
And death.

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,766
Back then, the world
was divided in two.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,684
Vicious predator...

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,525
or meek prey.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,001
But over time, we evolved.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,807
And moved beyond
our primitive, savage ways.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,402
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,844
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,921
Yeah.

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,523
I don't have to cower
in a herd anymore.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,247
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,443
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,967
Today, I can hunt for
tax exemptions.

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,965
I'm gonna be an actuary!

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,284
And I can make the world
a better place.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,090
I am going to be...

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,963
A police officer!

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
Bunny cop?

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,651
That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,565
It may seem impossible
to small minds...

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,405
But, just 211 miles away...

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,127
stands the great city of Zootopia!

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,643
Where our ancestors first
joined together in peace...

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,206
and declared that anyone
can be anything!

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,081
Thank you and good night!

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Judy, you ever wonder
how your mom and me...

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,210
got to be so darn happy?

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,361
Nope.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,211
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,562
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,610
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,041
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,651
I like trying actually.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,245
What you father means, hon...

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,925
is it's gonna be difficult...

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,401
impossible even, for you
to become a police officer.

46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,045
Right. There's never been
a bunny cop.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,321
- Never.
- Never.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,331
Oh. Then, I guess
I'll have to be the first one.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,449
Because I am gonna make...

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,126
the world a better place.

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,681
Or, uh, heck,
you know, you want to talk...

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,126
about making the world
a better place...

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,089
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,123
Yes! Your dad, me...

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,567
your 275 brothers and sisters.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,370
- We're changing the world!
- Yeah.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,523
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,160
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,201
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,725
Just putting the seeds
in the ground.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,604
Ah, at one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
You get it, honey.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
It's great to have dreams.

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
Yeah. Just as long as you don't...

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,405
believe in them too much.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,206
Where'd the heck she go?

68
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,120
Give me your tickets right now...

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,531
or I'm gonna kick your...

70
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,085
- meek little sheep butt.
- Ow!

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,645
Cut it out, Gideon!

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,201
Baa! Baa!
What are you gonna do? Cry?

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,290
Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,369
Nice costume, loser.

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,523
What crazy world are you living in...

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,927
where you think
a bunny could be a cop?

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,162
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,481
Come and get them.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,483
But watch out, because I'm a fox...

80
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,688
and like you said in your
dumb little stage play...

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,201
us predators used to eat prey.

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,681
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah."

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,968
Uh, I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,605
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,763
You don't scare me, Gideon.

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,608
You scared now?

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,807
Look at her nose twitch!

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
She is scared!

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,445
Cry little baby bunny.

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,681
Cry, Cry...

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,482
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,444
I want you to remember this moment...

93
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,560
the next time you think...

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,201
you will ever be anything more
than just a stupid...

95
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,091
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,681
That looks bad.

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,370
Are you okay, Judy?

98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,648
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,607
- Here you go.
- Oh!

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,449
Wow! You got our tickets!

101
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,966
You're awesome, Judy!

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,522
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,802
Well, he was right about one thing.

104
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,688
I don't know when to quit.

105
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,207
Listen up, cadets.

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,930
Zootopia has 12 unique...

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,401
ecosystems within its city limits.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,687
Tundratown...

109
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,921
Sahara Square...

110
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,924
Rainforest District, to name a few.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,328
You're gonna have
to master all of them...

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,767
before you hit the streets,
or guess what?

113
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,849
You'll be dead!

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,929
Scorching sandstorm!

115
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,605
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

116
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,241
1,000-foot fall!

117
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,606
Whoa!

118
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,484
You're dead, Carrot Face!

119
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,928
Frigid ice wall!

120
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,605
Whoop!

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,360
You're dead, Farm Girl!

122
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,205
Enormous criminal.

123
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,084
You're dead.
Dead, dead, dead!

124
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,846
Whoa...

125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,645
Filthy toilet!

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,325
You're dead, Fluff Butt.

127
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,167
<i>Just quit and go home,
fuzzy bunny!</i>

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,481
<i>There's never been
a bunny cop.</i>

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,761
<i>- Never.
- Never.</i>

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,446
<i>Just a stupid,
carrot-farming dumb bunny.</i>

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,490
<i>As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...</i>

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,929
<i>that my Mammal inclusion
Initiative has produced...</i>

133
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,731
<i>its first police academy graduate.</i>

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,650
<i>Valedictorian of her class...</i>

135
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,242
<i>ZPD's very first rabbit officer...</i>

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,482
<i>Judy Hopps.</i>

137
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,051
Oh, gosh.

138
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
<i>Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
her badge.</i>

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,731
- Oh, yes. Right!
- Thank you.

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
Yay, Judy!

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
<i>Judy.</i>

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,367
<i>it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...</i>

143
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,050
<i>to the heart of Zootopia:</i>

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,765
<i>Precinct One.</i>

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,923
<i>City Center.</i>

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,689
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

147
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
I won't let you down.

148
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,529
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,248
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

150
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Bellwether, make room,
will you? Come on.

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,447
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,364
- Officer Hopps, right here!
- Look this way please!

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
Hold still. Smile!

154
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,726
We're real proud of you, Judy.

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,365
Yeah. Scared, too.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of...

157
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,887
a proud-scared combo.

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,487
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

159
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,607
Guys...

160
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,729
I've been working for this my whole life.

161
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,967
We know. And we're just...

162
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,248
a little excited for you, but terrified.

163
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,041
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

164
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,721
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,246
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

166
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,481
- Wolves?
- Weasels.

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,801
You play cribbage with a weasel.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,961
Yeah. And he cheats
like there's no tomorrow.

169
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,161
You know what, pretty much...

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,084
all predators.
And Zootopia's full of them.

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,241
Oh, Stu.

172
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,731
And foxes are the worst.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,571
Actually, your father does
have a point there.

174
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,011
It's in their biology.

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,446
Remember what happened
with Gideon Grey?

176
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,091
When I was nine.

177
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,250
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

178
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,289
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

179
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,171
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

180
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,401
we made you a little care...

181
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,567
- package to take with you.
- Mmm-hmm.

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
And I put some snacks in there.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,843
- This is fox deterrent.
- Yeah, that's safe...

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,081
- to have that. Okay.
- This is fox repellent.

185
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,201
The deterrent and the repellent...

186
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,361
- that's all she needs.
- Check this out!

187
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,760
Oh, for goodness sake.

188
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,524
She has no need for
a fox Taser, Stu.

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,967
Oh, come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,766
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
Terrific! Everyone wins!

Rickety bed.

They really did hire
a bunny! What!

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,725
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter...

276

than I thought you'd be!

277
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,607
Oh, ah. You probably didn't know...

278
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,564
but a bunny can call
another bunny "cute"...

279
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,211
but when other animals do it...

280
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,250
it's a little...

281
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,167
I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

282
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,084
the guy everyone thinks
is just a flabby...

283
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,244

No, it's okay.
Oh, you've actually got...

285

In your neck. The fold.

Oh, Bullpen's over there to the left.

291
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,160
- Great. Thank you.
- Aw...

292

That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

293
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,769
Hey, Officer Hopps.

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,764
You ready to make the world

295
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Atten-hut!

296
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,929
Hut! Hut! Hut!

297
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,124
All right. All right! Everybody sit.

298
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,531
I've got three items on the docket.

299
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,525
First... we need to acknowledge...

300
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,409
the elephant in the room.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,081
Francine...

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,201
Happy birthday.

303
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,611
Oh, yeah.

304
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,366
Oh. Oh.

305
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,441
Number two.

306
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,564
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

307
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
but I'm not going to...

308
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,689
because I don't care.

309
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,566
Finally, we have 14
missing mammal cases.

310
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,167
All predators, from a giant polar bear...

311
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,651
to a teensy little otter.

312
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,845
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.

313
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,283
This is priority number one.

314
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,606
Assignments.

315
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,001

Fangmeyer, Delgato.

317
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,641
Your teams take missing mammals...

318
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,604
from the Rainforest District.

319
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,891
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

320
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,407
Your teams take Sahara Square.

321
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,683
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

322
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,843
<i>Tundratown.</i>

323
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,845
And finally, our first bunny...

324
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,560
Officer Hopps.

325
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,361
Parking Duty.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,126
Dismissed.

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,004
Parking duty?

328
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,361
- Chief!
- Hmm.

329
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Chief Bogo?

330
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,287
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

331
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,090
- So?
- So, I can handle one.

332
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,446
You probably forgot...

333
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,682
but I was top of my class
at the Academy.

334
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,361
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

335
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,562
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

336
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,046
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day...

337
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,571
should be easy.

338
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,445
100 tickets. I'm not gonna
write 100 tickets.

339
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,722
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

340
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,041
Before noon.

341
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,927
Boom!

342
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,043
200 tickets before noon!

343
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Oh...

344
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
201.

345
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,486
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

346
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,167
Mmm.

347
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,324
Where'd he go?

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,566
Listen, I don't know what
you're doing skulking...

349
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
around during daylight hours...

350
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,368
but I don't want any trouble in here.

351
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,329
So, hit the road.

352
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,369
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir.

353
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,370
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

354
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,051
for my little boy.

355
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,847
You want the red or the blue, pal?

356
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,681
Aw...

357
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,445
I'm such a...

358
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,767
Oh, come on, kid. Back up.

359
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,887
Listen, buddy. What?

360
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,126
There aren't any fox ice cream joints...

361
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,521
in your part of town?

362
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
Uh, no, no. There are.

363
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,561
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

364
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,046
he loves all things elephant.

365
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,690
Wants to be one when he grows up.

366
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,804
Is that adorable?

367
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,201
Oh!

368
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,563
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?

369
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,368
Look, you probably can't read, fox...

370
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,561
but the sign says...

371
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,764
"We reserve the right
to refuse service...

372
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,207
"...to anyone." So, beat it.

373
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,403
You're holding up the line.

374
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,122
Hello? Excuse me.

375
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,527
Hey, you're gonna have
to wait your turn...

376
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,244
like everyone else, meter maid.

377
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,369
Actually, I'm an officer.

378
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,925
Just had a quick question.

379
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,884
Are your customers aware...

380
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,445
they're getting snot and mucus...

381
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,602
with their cookies and cream?

382
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,966
What are you talking about?

383
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,362
Well, I don't want to
cause you any trouble...

384
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,606
but I believe scooping ice cream...

385
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,120
with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3...

386
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,441
health code violation.

387
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,242
Which is kind of a big deal.

388
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,320
Of course, I could let you off
with a warning...

389
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,086
if you were to glove those
trunks and, I don't know...

390
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,608
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

391
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,841
What was it?

392
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,962
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

393
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,964
A Jumbo Pop.

394
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,881
$15.

395
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,129
Thank you so much. Thank you.

396
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,483
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

397
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,324
I'd lose my head if it weren't
attached to my neck.

398
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,606
That's the truth.

399
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,569
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.

400
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,444
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

401
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,768
Please don't be mad at me.

402
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,606
Thanks anyway.

403
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,125
Keep the change.

404
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,283
Officer, I can't
thank you enough.

405
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,171
So kind, really.
Can I pay you back?

406
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,807
Oh, no, my treat. It just...

407
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,690
You know, it burns me up
to see folks...

408
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,968
with such backward attitudes
toward foxes.

409
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,925
I just wanna say you're
a great dad and just a...

410
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,970
a real articulate fella.

411
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,844
Oh, well, that is high praise.

412
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,611
It's rare that I find someone
so non-patronizing.

413
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Officer...

414
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,086
Hopps. Mister...

415
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,447
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

416
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,005
And you, little guy...

417
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,004
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up?

418
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,366
You be an elephant.

419
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,648
Because this is Zootopia.

420
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,043
Anyone can be anything.

421
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,040
Oh, boy, I tell him that all the time.

422
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,004
All right, here you go.
Two paws. Yeah.

423
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,526
Oh, look at that smile.

424
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,170
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

425
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,687
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

426
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,206
Toot-toot!

427
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Bye, now.

428
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Goodbye!

429
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,847
Oh!

430
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,884
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

431
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,087
Popsicles!

432
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,406
Get your popsicles!

433
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,081
Oh.

434
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,841
Lumber delivery.

435
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,041
What's with the color?

436
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,201
The color?

437
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,044
Uh, that's red wood.

438
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,568
39, 40. There you go.

439
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,609
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

440
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,726
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

441
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,965
You kiss me tomorrow,

442
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,121
I'll bite your face off.

443
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,921
Ciao.

444
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,249
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

445
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,641
You liar!

446
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,490
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,648
And I'm not the liar. He is.

448
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,281
Hey!

449
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,245
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

450
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,766
Really? For what?

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,321
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit.

452
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Transporting undeclared
commerce across borough lines.

453
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,841
False advertising.

454
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,811
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

455
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,321
And I didn't falsely advertise
anything. Take care.

456
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,682
You told that mouse the
popsicle sticks were redwood!

457
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,281
That's right. "Red wood."
With a space in the middle.

458
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,811
Wood that is red.

459
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,601
You can't touch me, Carrots.

460
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,200
I've been doing this since I was born.

461
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,084
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

462
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,805
My bad. I just naturally assumed...

463
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,042
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

464
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Uh, no!

465
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,446
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County...

466
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,720
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

467
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,287
Okay. Tell me if this story
sounds familiar.

468
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,807
Naive little hick with
good grades and big ideas...

469
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,691
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

470
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,644
where predators
and prey live in harmony...

471
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,847
and sing 'Kumbaya."'

472
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,969
Only to find, whoopsie...

473
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,565
we don't all get along.

474
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,364
And that dream of becoming
a big city cop?

475
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,562
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.

476
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

477
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,248
no one cares about her or her dreams.

478
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,369
And soon enough, those dreams die...

479
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,925
and our bunny sinks into emotional...

480
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,120
and literal squalor living
in a box under a bridge...

481
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,527
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

482
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,087
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy
little tail between...

483
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
her legs to become...

484
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,965
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

485
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,044
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

486
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,929
Oh!

487
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
Be careful, now,
or it won't just...

488
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,171
be your dreams getting crushed.

489
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,564
Hey! Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

490
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,728
Especially not some jerk...

491
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,849
who never had the guts to try to be...

492
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,406
anything more than a popsicle hustler.

493
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,002
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

494
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,004
thinking they can be anything they want.

495
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,605
Well, you can't.

496
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,882
You can only be what you are.

497
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,321
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

498
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,329
I'm not a dumb bunny.

499
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,811
Right. And that's not wet cement.

500
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
You'll never be a real cop.

501
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,240
You're a cute meter maid, though.

502
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,644
Maybe a supervisor one day.

503
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,803
Hang in there.

504
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,568

<i>Oh, there she is! Hi, sweetheart!</i>

510
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,086
<i>Hey there, Jude the dude.</i>

511
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,804
<i>How was your first day
on the force?</i>

512
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,723
- It was real great.
- Yeah?

513
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
<i>Everything you ever hoped?</i>

514
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,680
Mmm. Absolutely.

515
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,325
And more.

516
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,126
Everyone's so nice
and I feel like I'm really...

517
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,845
- making a difference.
- Wait a second.

518
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,400
<i>Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.</i>

519
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,925
<i>Oh, my sweet heaven!</i>

520
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,128
<i>Judy, are you a meter maid?</i>

521
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,601
Oh, this? No! Oh, no. This is
just a temporary thing.

522
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,320
<i>Oh, it's the safest job on the force!</i>

523
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,686
<i>Oh, she's not a real cop.</i>

524
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,887
<i>Our prayers have been answered!</i>

525
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,126
<i>Glorious day!</i>

526
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,321
<i>Oh, meter maid! Meter maid!</i>

527
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,171
<i>- Meter maid! Meter maid!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!</i>

528
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,200
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

529
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,361
<i>That's right, you get some rest.</i>

530
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,760
<i>Those meters aren't gonna
maid themselves.</i>

531
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,326
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

532
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,650
Buh-bye.

533
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,891
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

534
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,646
Leave the meter maid alone.

535
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,171
Didn't you hear her conversation?

536
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,441
She feels like a failure!

537
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,210
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

538
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,361
You shut up!

539
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,607
You shut up!

540
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,569
Tomorrow's another day.

541
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,967
Yeah, but it might be worse!

542
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,411
I was 30 seconds over!

543
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,968
Ugh! Yeah, you're a real hero, lady!

544
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,841
My mommy says she wishes
you were dead.

545
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,767
Uncool, rabbit.

546
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,047
My tax dollars pay your salary.

547
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,524
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

548
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,291
Hey, hey, hey! You, bunny!

549
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,329
Sir. If you have a grievance,

550
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,329
you may contest your citation
in traffic court.

551
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,369
What are you talking about?
My shop!

552
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,329
- It was just robbed! Look!
- Oh!

553
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,965
He's getting away!

554
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,611
Are you a cop or not?

555
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,531
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir!
I've got this!

556
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,761
- Stop!
- Huh?

557
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
Stop, in the name of the law!

558
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,801
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

559
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,923
Whoa! Whoa!

560
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,326
Whoa.

561
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,521
Coming through!

562
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,250
This is Officer McHorn,
we got a 10-31.

563
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,487
I got dibs!

564
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,165
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

565
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,125
Whoo-whoo!

566
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,846
Whoa!

567
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Ha!

568
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,450
You!

569
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Freeze!

570
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,802
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!

571
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,121
Stop!

572
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Oh...

573
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,041
Oh!

574
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Sorry. Coming through.

575
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,367
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

576
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,201
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

577
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,041
Huh?

578
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,730
Ha! Oh...

579
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,291
Hey, stop right there!

580
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,806
Have a donut, copper!

581
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,962
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard printjeggings?

582
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Oh!

583
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,605
I love your hair.

584
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,161
Thank you.

585
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,408
Come to papa.

586
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,166
Okay. You're gonna
have to be patient...

587
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,646
and wait in line
just like everyone else...

588
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,928
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

589
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,722
I popped the weasel!

590
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,604
Hopps!

591
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,210
Abandoning your post.

592
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,770
Inciting a scurry.

593
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,883
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

594
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,923
But, to be fair...

595
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,451
you did stop a master criminal...

596
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,608
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

597
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,567
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir...

598
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,886
but those aren't onions.

599
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,286
Those are a crocus varietal...

600
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,731
<i>called midnicampum holicithias.</i>

601
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,251
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

602
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,401
Well, I grew up in a family...

603
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,681
where plant husbandry
was kind of a thing.

604
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,649
Shut your tiny mouth now!

605
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,289
Sir, I got the bad guy.

606
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,561
That's my job.

607
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,524
Your job is putting tickets...

608
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,960
on parked cars!

609
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,041
Chief...

610
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,880
<i>uh, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.</i>

611
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,251
<i>- Not now.
- Okay, I just didn't know...</i>

612
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,367
<i>if you'd want to take it this time.</i>

613
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,521
<i>She seems really upset.</i>

614
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,840
- Not now!
- Sir...

615
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,724
I don't want to be a meter maid...

616
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,962
I want to be a real cop.

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,289
Do you think the mayor asked
what I wanted...

618
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,042
when he assigned you to me?

619
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,246
But, sir, if...

620
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,680
Life isn't some cartoon musical...

621
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,131
where you sing a little song...

622
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,688
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

623
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,288
So, let it go.

624
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,970
Chief Bogo, please.

625
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,724
Five minutes of your time. Please.

626
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
I'm sorry, sir.

627
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,202
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

628
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,005
I gotta go sit down.

629
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,529
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

630
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,081
My husband has been missing
for 10 days.

631
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,566
His name is Emmitt Otterton.

632
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Yes, I know.

633
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,888
He's a florist.

634
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,525
We have two beautiful children.

635
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,324
He would never just disappear.

636
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,445
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.

637
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,687
Please.

638
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,604
There's got to be somebody
to find my Emmitt.

639
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,887
Mrs. Otterton...

640
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
I will find him.

641
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
Oh!

642
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,090
Thank you.

643
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,527
- Bless you.
- Oh!

644
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,284
Bless you, little bunny.

645
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,727
Oh.

646
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,081
Take this.

647
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,527
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

648
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,643
to me and my babies, please.

649
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,166
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

650
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,970
Of course. Oh, thank you both so much.

651
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
One second.

652
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,684
You're fired.

653
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,006
What? Why?

654
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
Insubordination!

655
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,330
Now. I'm going to open this door...

656
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,885
and you're going to tell that otter...

657
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,331
you're a former meter maid...

658
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,528
with delusions of grandeur...

659
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,449
who will not be taking the case!

660
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,490
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

661
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,006
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

662
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,560
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative...

663
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,523
is really starting to pay off.

664
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,280
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

665
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,521
No, no, let's not tell
the Mayor just yet.

666
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,491
And I've sent it and it is
done, so I did do that.

667
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
All right. Well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.

668
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,001
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

669
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,481
Like glue.

670
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,006
Good one.

671
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,123
Just call me if you ever
need anything, okay?

672
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,200
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

673
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,651
All right, bye-bye.

674
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,882
Thank you, ma'am.

675
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,880
I will give you 48 hours.

676
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,207
Yes!

677
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,561
That's two days to find
Emmitt Otterton.

678
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,721
Okay.

679
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,930
But, you strike out, you resign.

680
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,082
Oh! Uh...

681
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,161
Okay.

682
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,281
Deal!

683
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Splendid.

684
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,091
Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

685
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Here you go.

686
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,085
One missing otter.

687
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,841
That's it?

688
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,004
Yikes! That is the smallest
case file I've ever seen.

689
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,402
Leads, none. Witnesses, none.

690
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,090
And you're not
in the computer system yet...

691
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,442
so resources, None!

692
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,091
Oh, I hope you didn't stake
your career...

693
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,930
on cracking this one!

694
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,248
Okay. Last known sighting.

695
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,967
Can I just borrow... Thank you.

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,047
Popsicle?

697
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,805
The murder weapon.

698
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,451
Get your popsicle.

699
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,281
Yeah. Because that...
What does that mean?

700
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,521
It means...

701
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,721
I have a lead.

702
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,766
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

703
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,964
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

704
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,963
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

705
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,200
and I'm here to ask you
some questions about a case.

706
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,401
What happened, meter maid?

707
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,840
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

708
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,610
It wasn't me.

709
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,005
Hey, Carrots, you're going
to wake the baby.

710
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,161
I gotta get to work.

711
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,487
This is important, sir.

712
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,849
I think your $10 worth
of popsicles can wait.

713
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,129
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff!

714
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,483
365 days a year, since I was 12.

715
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,250
And time is money. Hop along.

716
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,244
Please, just look at the picture.

717
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,811
You sold Mr. Otterton
that popsicle, right?

718
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,967
Do you know him?

719
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,161
I know everybody.

720
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,603
And I also know that, somewhere...

721
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,966
there's a toy store missing
its stuffed animal...

722
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,765
so why don't you get back to your box?

723
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Fine. Then we'll have
to do this the hard way.

724
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,010
Did you just boot my stroller?

725
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,009
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

726
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,840
Ha! For what?
Hurting your feelings?

727
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,206
Felony Tax Evasion.

728
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,686
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year...

729
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,046
since you were 12.

730
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,203
That's two decades, so times 20...

731
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,966
which is $1,460,000, I think.

732
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,282
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny...

733
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,731
but we are good at multiplying.

734
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,649
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

735
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,486
you reported, let me see here... zero!

736
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,371
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form...

737
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,891
is a punishable offense.

738
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,526
Five years jail time.

739
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,882
Well, it's my word against yours.

740
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,649
<i>200 bucks a day, Fluff!</i>

741
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,565
<i>365 days a year, since I was 12.</i>

742
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,484
Actually, it's your word against yours.

743
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,484
And if you want this pen,
you're going to help me...

744
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,011
find this poor, missing otter...

745
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,969
or the only place you'll be
selling popsicles...

746
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,168
is the prison cafeteria.

747
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

748
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,363
She hustled you.

749
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,051
She hustled you good!

750
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,369
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

751
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,687
Have fun...

752
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,926
working with the fuzz!

753
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,611
Start talking.

754
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,246
I don't know where he is.

755
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,566
I only saw where he went.

756
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,761
Great. Let's go.

757
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,003
It's not exactly a place for, uh...

758
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,441
a cute little bunny.

759
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,404
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

760
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,841
Okay. You're the boss.

761
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,486
Om!

762
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,851
Hi.

763
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Hello?

764
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,605
Om!

765
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,291
Um, hello?

766
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,523
Hello? Hello?

767
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Hmm?

768
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
- Hello. My name is...
- Oh...

769
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,480
You know, I'm going to hit...

770
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,489
the pause button right there...

771
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,842
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

772
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,889
Uh... no.

773
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,327
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

774
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,722
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

775
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,245
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

776
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,006
who may have frequented
this establishment.

777
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,647
Hmm.

778
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,326
Yeah, Old Emmitt.

779
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,847
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

780
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,169
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

781
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,010
I'd be happy to take you back.

782
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,491
Oh, thank you so much.
I'd appreciate that...

783
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,005
more than you can imagine,
it would be such...

784
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,849
- Ohh! You are naked!
- Huh?

785
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,004
Oh, for sure, we're
a naturalist club.

786
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,249
Yeah. In Zootopia,
anyone can be anything.

787
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,443
These guys, they be naked.

788
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,570
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

789
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,201
Oh, boy.

790
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,169
Does this make you uncomfortable?

791
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,728
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

792
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,889
Yes, there is.

793
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,043
Boy, that's the spirit.

794
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,845
Yeah, some mammals say...

795
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,371
the naturalist life is weird...

796
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,483
but you know what I say is weird?

797
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,609
Clothes on animals!

798
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,050
- Here we go.
- Mmm...

799
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,368
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant...

800
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,881
so she'll totally remember everything.

801
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,161
Hey, Nangi.

802
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,050
These dudes have some questions...

803
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,525
about Emmitt the otter.

804
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Who?

805
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,449
Uh... Emmitt Otterton?

806
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,240
Been coming to your
yoga class for like...

807
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,441
6 years?

808
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,205
I have no memory of this beaver.

809
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,084
He's an otter, actually.

810
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,080
He was here a couple
Wednesdays ago, remember?

811
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
No.

812
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,201
Yeah, he was wearing...

813
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,726
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

814
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,082
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.

815
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,244
Oh, and a paisley tie,
sweet Windsor knot.

816
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,283
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

817
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,726
No.

818
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,924
Yeah, and we both walked
him out, and he got into...

819
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,611
this big old white car
with a silver trim.

820
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,605
Needed a tune-up. The third
cylinder wasn't firing.

821
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,768
- Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

822
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,089
Uh... You didn't happen to catch...

823
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,567
the license plate number, did you?

824
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,604
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

825
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,569
T-H-D...

826
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,649
- 0-3.
- JUDY: 0-3. Wow.

827
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,440
This is a lot of great info.
Thank you.

828
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,609
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

829
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,646
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

830
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,128
Well, I had a ball.

831
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,600
You are welcome for the clue...

832
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,848
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate...

833
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,810
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

834
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,760
The plate. I can't run a plate.

835
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,246
I'm not in the system yet.

836
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,324
Give me the pen, please.

837
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,090
What was it you said?

838
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,282
"Any moron can run a plate"?

839
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,410
Gosh. If only there were
a moron around...

840
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,090
who were up to the task.

841
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,731
Rabbit, I did what you asked!

842
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,490
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

843
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,251
Not forever. Well, I only
have 36 hours left...

844
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,964
to solve this case.

845
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,561
So can you run the plate or not?

846
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,247
Actually, I just remembered...

847
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,811
<i>I have a pal at the DMV.</i>

848
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,520
<i>Flash is the fastest guy in there.</i>

849
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,330
If you need something done, he's on it.

850
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,010
I hope so. We are
really fighting the clock...

851
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,161
and every minute counts.

852
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,090
Wait. They're all sloths?

853
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,964
You said this was going to be quick!

854
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,690
Are you saying
that because he's a sloth...

855
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,171
he can't be fast?

856
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,840
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

857
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,605
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.

858
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

859
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,969
Nice to...

860
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,961
see you...

861
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,447
too.

862
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,961
Hey, Flash, I'd love you
to meet my friend.

863
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,650
Uh, darling, I've forgotten your name.

864
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,761
Hmm.

865
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,360
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

866
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,846
I am...

867
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,487
doing...

868
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,371
Just...

869
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,721
Fine?

870
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,042
...as well as...

871
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,406
I can...

872
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,881
- be.
- Hmm.

873
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,166
- What...
- Hang in there.

874
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,447
...can I...

875
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,525
- do...
- Well, I was hoping...

876
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,040
- you could run a...
- ...for you...

877
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,161
Well, I was hoping you could...

878
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,241
...today?

879
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,401
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

880
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,250
We are in a really big hurry.

881
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,161
Sure.

882
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,686
What's the...

883
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,009
- plate...
- 2-9-T...

884
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,287
...number?

885
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,163
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

886
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,401
Two...

887
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,886
nine...

888
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,208
T-H-D-0-3.

889
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,531
H-D-0-3.

890
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,403
D-0-3.

891
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,681
- Mmm-hmm.

892
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,211
0-3.

893
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,681
3.

894
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,966
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

895
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,286
No!

896
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,086
Sure.

897
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,290
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

898
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,691
I don't...

899
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,046
know.

900
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,401
What...

901
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,481
do...

902
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,284
you call...

903
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,244
- a...
- Three-humped camel.

904
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,970
...three-humped...

905
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
camel?

906
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Pregnant.

907
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,080
Ha-ha! Yes, very funny, very funny.

908
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,640
Can we please just focus on the...

909
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,966
- Hey...
- Wait, wait, wait!

910
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,446
...Priscilla!

911
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,841
Oh, no!

912
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,290
Yes...

913
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,010
Flash?

914
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,127
- What...
- Oh!

915
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Do...

916
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,964
- No!
- ...you call a...

917
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,360
A three-humped camel?
"Pregnant!"

918
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Okay, great, we got it.

919
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,927
- ...three... humped...
- Please just...

920
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,130
- Here...
- Yeah. Hurry.

921
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,328
- ...you...
- Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

922
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,401
...go.

923
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,967
It's registered
to Tundratown Limo Service.

924
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,202
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

925
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,361
It's in Tundratown!

926
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,160
Way to hustle, bud.
I love you. I owe you.

927
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,089
Hurry! We gotta beat
the rush hour, and...

928
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,561
It's night?

929
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,002
Closed. Great.

930
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,242
Mmm.
And I will bet you...

931
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,171
you don't have
a warrant to get in. Hmm?

932
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,209
Darn it. It's a bummer.

933
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,209
You wasted the day on purpose.

934
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,323
Madam, I have a fake badge.

935
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,562
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

936
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,565
It's not a pretend
investigation. Look, see?

937
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,041
See him? This otter is missing.

938
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,767
Well, then they should've
gotten a real cop to find him.

939
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,246
What is your problem?

940
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Does seeing me fail somehow
make you feel better...

941
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,244
about your own sad, miserable life?

942
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,448
It does. 100%.

943
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,849
Now, since you're sans warrant...

944
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,845
I guess we're... done?

945
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,604
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

946
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,086
Hey!

947
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,965
First off, you throw like a bunny.

948
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,168
Second, you're a very sore loser.

949
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,646
See you later, Officer Fluff.

950
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,611
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

951
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,842
The thing is, you don't need a warrant...

952
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,161
if you have probable cause...

953
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,360
and I'm pretty sure I saw...

954
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,125
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

955
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,761
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

956
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,646
2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This is it!

957
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,766
Polar bear fur.

958
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,325
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

959
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,240
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

960
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,364
But on CD.

961
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,011
Who still uses CDs?

962
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,527
Carrots, if your otter was here...

963
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,404
he had a very bad day.

964
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,367
Those are claw marks.

965
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,690
You ever seen anything like this?

966
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,007
No.

967
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,925
Oh, wait, look.

968
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,208
This is him,
Emmitt Otterton.

969
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,761
He was definitely here.

970
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,082
What do you think happened?

971
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,040
Well, now, wait a minute.

972
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,725
Polar bear fur,
Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

973
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,520
I know whose car this is.
We got to go.

974
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,721
Why? Whose car is it?

975
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown.

976
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,726
They call him Mr. Big.

977
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,281
And he does not like me.
So we gotta go!

978
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,204
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.

979
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,486
Well, it's gonna be
an even bigger crime scene...

980
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,720
if Mr. Big finds me here...

981
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,330
so we're leaving right now.

982
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
Raymond!

983
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,567
And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

984
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,086
And, speaking of "No see"...

985
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,409
how about you forget you saw me, huh?

986
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,766
For old times' sake?

987
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,887
That's a no.

988
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,889
Oh...

989
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,927
What did you do that made...

990
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,206
Mr. Big so mad at you?

991
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,842
I, uh, I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

992
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,886
that was made from the fur of a skunk...

993
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,083
...'s butt.

994
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,401
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

995
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,480
Is that Mr. Big?

996
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,727
No.

997
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,921
What about him?

998
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,400
- Is that him?
- No!

999
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,441
That's got to be him.

1000
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,320
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!

1001
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,449
- Huh.
- Mr. Big, sir.

1002
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,607
This is a simple...

1003
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,321
Yeah. Here...

1004
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,321
Mmm...

1005
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,490
This is a simple misunderstanding.

1006
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Oh...

1007
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,280
You come here, unannounced...

1008
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,164
on the day my daughter
is to be married.

1009
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,482
Well, actually, we were brought here...

1010
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
against our will, so...

1011
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,521
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

1012
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,201
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

1013
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,441
Meh.

1014
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,329
I trusted you, Nicky.

1015
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,489
I welcomed you into my home.

1016
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,808
We broke bread together.

1017
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,288
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

1018
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,722
And how did you repay my generosity?

1019
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,851
With a rug made from the butt
of a skunk.

1020
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,809
A skunk-butt rug.

1021
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,530
You disrespected me.

1022
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,842
You disrespected my Gram-mama...

1023
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,480
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

1024
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,526
I told you never to show
your face here again...

1025
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,681
but here you are...

1026
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,645
snooping around with this...

1027
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,160
What are you? A performer?

1028
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,486
What's with the costume?

1029
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Sir. I am a...

1030
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,211
Mime! She is a mime.

1031
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,363
This... mime cannot speak.

1032
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,521
You can't speak if you're a mime.

1033
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,165
- No, I am a cop.
- Ugh...

1034
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,765
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

1035
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,526
And my evidence puts him in your car.

1036
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,165
So intimidate me all you want.

1037
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,442
I'm going to find out
what you did to that otter...

1038
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,080
if it's the last thing I do.

1039
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
Meh.

1040
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,005
Then I have only one request.

1041
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,602
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.

1042
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,205
Whoa!

1043
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,731
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

1044
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,126
And you never will.

1045
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,930
- Please! No, no, no!
- Put me down!

1046
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,367
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!

1047
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,610
Oh, Daddy! It's time for our dance!

1048
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,246
Oh, what did we say?

1049
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,562
No icing anyone at my wedding!

1050
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,207
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

1051
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
Ice 'em.

1052
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
No, no, no!

1053
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Wait. Please!

1054
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,884
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

1055
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,451
From that giant donut.

1056
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
This bunny?

1057
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,490
Yeah! Hi!

1058
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,041
Hi. I love your dress.

1059
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,049
- Oh. Thank you.
- Oh.

1060
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Put 'em down.

1061
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,445
You've done me a great service.

1062
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,762
I will help you find the otter.

1063
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,921
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

1064
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,090
Smile.

1065
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,404
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1066
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,164
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1067
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Hmm.

1068
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,604
Otterton is my florist.

1069
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,441
He's like a part of the family.

1070
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,610
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

1071
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,684
That's why I sent that car
to pick him up.

1072
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,164
But he never arrived.

1073
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,965
Because he was attacked.

1074
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,806
No. He attacked.

1075
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,367
Otterton?

1076
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,604
Otterton. He went crazy.

1077
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,805
Ripped up the car, scared
my driver half to death...

1078
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,321
and disappeared into the night.

1079
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,729
But he's a sweet little otter.

1080
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,966
Hmm. My child, we may
be evolved, but deep down...

1081
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,487
we are still animals.

1082
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,607
<i>You want to find Otterton,</i>

1083
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,648
<i>talk to the driver of that car.</i>

1084
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,325
<i>His name is Manchas...</i>

1085
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,171
<i>lives in the Rainforest District.</i>

1086
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,806
<i>Only he can tell you more.</i>

1087
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,244
Mr. Manchas?

1088
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,369
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

1089
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,683
We just wanna know what
happened to Emmitt Otterton.

1090
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,601
<i>You...</i>

1091
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,001
should be asking...

1092
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,526
- what happened to me.
- Whoa!

1093
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,044
Uh, a teensy otter did that?

1094
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,401
What happened?

1095
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,688
He was an animal.

1096
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Down...

1097
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,527
<i>on all fours.</i>

1098
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,931
<i>He was a savage!</i>

1099
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,926
There was no warning.

1100
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,970
He just kept yelling about
the Night Howlers.

1101
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,044
Over and over.
The Night Howlers.

1102
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,449
So you know about
the Night Howlers, too?

1103
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,051
Good. Good, good.

1104
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,884
Because the Night Howlers...

1105
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,890
are exactly what we are here
to talk about.

1106
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,451
- Right?
- Yup.

1107
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,243
So, uh, so you just open the door...

1108
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,965
and tell us what you know...

1109
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,402
and we will tell you
what we know. Okay?

1110
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,088
Okay.

1111
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,083
Clever fox.

1112
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,928
Mr. Manchas?

1113
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Buddy?

1114
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Are you...

1115
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
okay?

1116
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,924
Run. Run!

1117
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,967
What is wrong with him?

1118
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,486
I don't know!

1119
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,520
Jump!

1120
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Come on!

1121
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,600
- Head down!
- Oh. Oh!

1122
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,480
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

1123
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,370
Are you familiar with Gazelle,
greatest singer

1124
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,280
of our lifetime,
angel with horns?

1125
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,970
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.

1126
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,400
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?

1127
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,728
<i>Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.</i>

1128
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,721
It's me!
Did you think it was real?

1129
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,880
It looks so real!

1130
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,646
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

1131
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,166
<i>Clawhauser!</i>

1132
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,647
Clawhauser, listen to me,
we have a 10-91!

1133
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,171
<i>Jaguar gone savage!</i>

1134
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
Vine and Tuh-junja!

1135
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,210
- It's "Tuh-hunga!"
- Whoa!

1136
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,200
<i>Okay, we're sending backup! Hopps?</i>

1137
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,851
<i>Hopps!</i>

1138
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,440
There!

1139
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,885
Head for the sky trams!

1140
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,844
Get in! Carrots.

1141
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Carrots!

1142
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,160
Go!

1143
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,329
No, no, no!

1144
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,760
Buddy.

1145
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,843
One predator to another...

1146
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,086
No, no, no...

1147
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,849
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

1148
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,200
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space! Ah!

1149
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,283
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

1150
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,290
- I'm gonna let go!
- No, you, what?

1151
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,249
- One, two...
- No...

1152
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,368
I said, do not... Rabbit!

1153
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,086
Carrots. You saved my life.

1154
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,891
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

1155
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,528
Hmm.

1156
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,490
Well, this should be good.

1157
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,731
I thought this was
just a missing mammal case...

1158
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,410
but it's way bigger.

1159
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,682
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

1160
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,885
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

1161
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,726
Savage? This isn't
the Stone Age, Hopps.

1162
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,729
Animals don't "go savage."

1163
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,089
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

1164
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,811
What? He was right here.

1165
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,565
The "savage" jaguar?

1166
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,765
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

1167
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,722
Or, maybe any aggressive predator...

1168
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,081
looks savage to you rabbits.

1169
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,241
Let's go!

1170
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Wait, sir.

1171
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,290
I'm not the only one who saw him.

1172
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,130
Nick!

1173
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,489
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

1174
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,370
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

1175
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,523
Two days to find the otter...

1176
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,569
or you quit.

1177
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,762
That was the deal.

1178
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,604
Badge.

1179
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,921
- But, sir, we...
- Badge!

1180
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,566
Uh, no.

1181
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,245
What did you say, fox?

1182
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,967
Sorry. What I said was, "No."

1183
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,806
She will not be giving you that badge.

1184
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,729
Look, you give her a clown vest...

1185
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,729
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

1186
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,200
and two days to solve a case...

1187
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,884
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

1188
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,801
Yeah.

1189
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,485
It's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.

1190
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,802
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

1191
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,320
- Ho...
- Here's the thing, Chief.

1192
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,805
You gave her the 48 hours...

1193
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,968
so, technically, we still have...

1194
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,288
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

1195
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,642
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

1196
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,080
So, if you'll excuse us...

1197
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,329
we have a very big lead
to follow and a case to crack.

1198
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,811
Good day.

1199
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,166
Officer Hopps.

1200
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,205
Thank you.

1201
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,681
Never let them see that
they get to you.

1202
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,201
So...

1203
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,761
things do get to you?

1204
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,361
No, I mean, not anymore...

1205
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,164
but I was small...

1206
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,521
and emotionally unbalanced
like you once.

1207
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,807
Har-har.

1208
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,803
No, it's true.

1209
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,044
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

1210
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,163
and all I wanted to do...

1211
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,523
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

1212
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,121
<i>So, my mom scraped together
enough money...</i>

1213
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,561
<i>to buy me a brand-new uniform...</i>

1214
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,127
<i>because, by God, I was gonna fit in.</i>

1215
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,643
<i>Even if I was the only
predator in the troop.</i>

1216
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
<i>The only fox.</i>

1217
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,040
Okay, Nick.

1218
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,525
<i>I was gonna be
part of a pack.</i>

1219
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,051
Ready for initiation?

1220
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,083
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

1221
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,006
<i>I was so proud.</i>

1222
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,721
Okay.

1223
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,241
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

1224
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,924
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

1225
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,010
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

1226
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,005
Even though you're a fox?

1227
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,766
What?

1228
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,320
No. No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

1229
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,442
No, please! Tell me!
What did I do wrong?

1230
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,369
<i>What did I do?</i>

1231
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,845
No...

1232
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,565
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox...

1233
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,721
without a muzzle...

1234
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,770
you're even dumber than you look!

1235
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,201
Cry baby.

1236
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,931
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1237
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,166
<i>I learned two things that day.</i>

1238
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,640
<i>One...</i>

1239
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,845
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.

1240
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,967
And two?

1241
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,766
If the world's only gonna see a fox...

1242
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,287
as shifty and untrustworthy...

1243
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,450
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

1244
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,167
Nick, you are so much more than that.

1245
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,964
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

1246
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,764
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

1247
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,800
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

1248
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,962
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

1249
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,411
The Jam Cams.

1250
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,251
- Seriously. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

1251
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,450
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

1252
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,284
All over the canopy!

1253
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,920
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

1254
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,201
The traffic cams would have caught it!

1255
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,686
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho!

1256
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,080
Pretty sneaky, slick!

1257
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,728
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before...

1258
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,407
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

1259
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,846
No.

1260
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,001
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

1261
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,611
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

1262
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,081
Sir...

1263
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,406
I'm so sorry. Sir!

1264
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,689
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

1265
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,767
Please. And clear
my afternoon. I'm going out.

1266
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,240
No, no! But, sir,
you do have a meeting...

1267
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,441
with Herds and Grazing.

1268
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,885
Sir, if I could just...

1269
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,489
Oh, mutton chops.

1270
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,771
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

1271
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,081
We need your help.

1272
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,920
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

1273
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,931
So fluffy!

1274
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,121
Hey!

1275
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,565
Sheep never let me get this close.

1276
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,200
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

1277
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,441
It's like cotton candy.

1278
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,521
Stop it!

1279
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,647
Where to?

1280
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,010
Uh, Rainforest District,
Vine and Tujunga.

1281
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,360
There! Traffic
cams for the whole city.

1282
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,528
Oh, this is so exciting, actually!

1283
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,400
I never get to do
anything this important.

1284
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,881
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

1285
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,401
Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary.

1286
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,041
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

1287
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,560
But he did give me that nice mug.

1288
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,486
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1289
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,165
Feels good to be appreciated.

1290
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,646
<i>Smell-wether!</i>

1291
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,531
Ugh. That's a fun little name
he likes to use.

1292
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,569
I called him Lion-fart once.

1293
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,921
He did not care for that.
Let me tell you...

1294
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,240
it was not a good day for me.

1295
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,327
Yes, sir?

1296
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,731
<i>I thought you were going
to cancel my afternoon!</i>

1297
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,849
Oh, dear. I better go.

1298
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,565
Let me know what you find.

1299
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,643
It was really nice for me to be...

1300
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,881
<i>- While we're young...
- Oh...</i>

1301
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,809
<i>Smell-wether!</i>

1302
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,884
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?

1303
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,804
Oh, shush. Okay, traffic cams.

1304
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,164
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

1305
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,360
- Who are these guys?
- Ugh.

1306
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,610
Timberwolves.
Look at these dumb-dumbs.

1307
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,811
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

1308
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,280
And there it is.

1309
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,171
What is it with wolves
and the howling? It's like...

1310
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,243
Howlers. Night Howlers.

1311
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,562
That's what Manchas
was afraid of! Wolves!

1312
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,120
The wolves are the Night Howlers.

1313
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,366
If they took Manchas...

1314
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,090
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

1315
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,766
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.

1316
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,361
Wait, where did they go?

1317
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,249
You know, if I wanted
to avoid surveillance...

1318
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,606
because I was doing
something illegal...

1319
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,887
which I never have...

1320
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,689
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1321
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,601
Which would put them out...

1322
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,810
right there.

1323
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,483
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

1324
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,762
You know, I think you'd actually...

1325
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,843
make a pretty good cop.

1326
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,809
Ugh. How dare you.

1327
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,241
Acacia Alley?

1328
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,606
Ficus Underpass.

1329
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,080
- South Canyon.
- Mmm-hmm.

1330
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,400
They're heading out of town.

1331
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,405
Where does that road go?

1332
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,207
Gary, quit it!

1333
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,446
You're gonna start a howl.

1334
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,160
I didn't start it!

1335
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,361
Come on.

1336
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,811
You are a clever bunny.

1337
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,729
It looks like
this was a hospital.

1338
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,450
You know, after you.
You're the cop.

1339
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,640
Hmm.

1340
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,686
- Okay, all clear.
- Ugh.

1341
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,041
Huh.

1342
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,687
All this equipment is brand new.

1343
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,361
Carrots.

1344
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,087
Claw marks.

1345
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,726
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
I mean, what kind of...

1346
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,163
Mr. Manchas.

1347
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,280
It's him.

1348
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,688
We found our otter.

1349
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,365
Mr. Otterton.

1350
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,843
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

1351
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,281
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1352
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,486
Or not.

1353
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,921
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

1354
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,249
11,12,13,14...

1355
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,450
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

1356
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,485
Chief Bogo handed out
14 missing mammal files.

1357
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,687
They're all here.

1358
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,646
All the missing mammals are right here.

1359
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,525
Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor!

1360
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,801
I want answers.

1361
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,086
Mayor Lionheart, please.

1362
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,964
We're doing everything we can.

1363
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,241
Really?

1364
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,126
Because I got a dozen
and a half animals here...

1365
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,844
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

1366
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,525
and you can't tell me why.

1367
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,451
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything."

1368
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,681
Sir...

1369
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,684
it may be time to consider their biology.

1370
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,729
What? What do you mean "biology?"

1371
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,571
The only animals
going savage are predators.

1372
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,525
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

1373
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,527
Hmm. Great idea. Tell the public.

1374
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,000
And how do you think they're...

1375
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,684
gonna feel about their mayor...

1376
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,524
who is a lion?

1377
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,841
I'll be ruined!

1378
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,126
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1379
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,448
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1380
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,490
And we are going to keep it that way.

1381
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,523
Oh, no, no, no!

1382
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,807
Someone's here.

1383
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,530
Sir, you need to go, now!

1384
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,364
Security! Sweep the area!

1385
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,124
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

1386
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,727
That's it. I'm dead,
you're dead. Everybody's dead!

1387
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,007
Can you swim?

1388
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,925
What? Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

1389
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,725
No, no, no!

1390
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,851
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1391
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,204
We gotta tell Bogo!

1392
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,840
<i>Wow!</i>

1393
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,806
<i>You are one hot dancer,
Chief Bogo.</i>

1394
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,004
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now!

1395
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,242
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No.

1396
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,131
<i>I'm Gazelle, and
you are one hot dancer.</i>

1397
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,130
You have the app too? Oh...

1398
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,526
Chief!

1399
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,006
Clawhauser, can't you see
I'm working...

1400
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,366
on the missing mammal cases?

1401
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,642
Oh, oh, oh! Yes of course!
About that, sir.

1402
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,121
Officer Hopps just called.

1403
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,321
She found all of them.

1404
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,162
<i>Wow! I'm impressed.</i>

1405
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,526
Mayor Lionheart,
you have the right...

1406
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,886
to remain silent. Anything...

1407
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,691
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!

1408
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,922
You were just trying
to protect your job.

1409
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,090
No. Listen, we still don't
know why this is happening.

1410
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,243
It could destroy Zootopia.

1411
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,761
You have the right to remain silent.

1412
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,166
Anything you say can and will...

1413
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,840
be used against you in a court of law.

1414
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,043
You have the right...

1415
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemammals.</i>

1416
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,010
<i>14 mammals went missing...</i>

1417
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,967
<i>and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...</i>

1418
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,560
<i>who will speak to you in a moment.</i>

1419
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,801
<i>But first, let me remind you...</i>

1420
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,041
Ugh. I'm so nervous.

1421
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,009
Okay. Press Conference 101.

1422
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,281
You wanna look smart?

1423
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,720
Answer their question
with your own question...

1424
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,930
and then answer that question.
Like this.

1425
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,525
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps...

1426
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,444
"uh, what can you tell us
about the case?"

1427
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,205
"Well, was this a tough case?

1428
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,368
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

1429
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,324
You should be there with me.

1430
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,800
We did this together.

1431
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,129
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

1432
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,402
Hmm. Funny you should say that...

1433
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,881
because I've been thinking...

1434
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,563
It would be nice to have a partner.

1435
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,170
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

1436
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,000
<i>At twenty-two hundred hours...</i>

1437
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,650
<i>we found all these missing animals...</i>

1438
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,247
Officer Hopps, it's time.

1439
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,806
<i>They appear to be
in good health, physically...</i>

1440
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,760
...if not emotionally.

1441
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,362
So now, I'll turn things over...

1442
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,285
to the officer who cracked the case.

1443
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,210
Officer Judy Hopps.

1444
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,609
- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

1445
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,841
Over here!

1446
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,960
Yes?

1447
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,605
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1448
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,408
Well, the animals
in question, um...

1449
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,568
Are they all different species?

1450
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,723
Yes. Yes, they are.

1451
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,123
Okay, so what is the connection?

1452
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,328
Oh, all we know is that they...

1453
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,050
are all members of the predator family.

1454
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,251
So, predators are
the only ones going savage?

1455
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,007
That is ac... Yes,
that is accurate. Yes.

1456
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,520
Why? Why is this happening?

1457
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,841
We still don't know.

1458
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,441
It may have something
to do with biology.

1459
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,846
What do you mean by that?

1460
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,043
A biological component.

1461
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,568
You know, something in their DNA.

1462
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,641
In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

1463
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,766
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1464
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,971
uh, predators survived through
their aggressive...

1465
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,844
hunting instincts.

1466
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,007
For whatever reason...

1467
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,329
they seem to be reverting back...

1468
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,410
to their primitive, savage ways.

1469
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,960
Of course they did.

1470
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,683
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1471
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,763
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1472
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,811
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.

1473
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,607
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1474
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,046
Will more mammals go savage?

1475
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,406
What is being done to protect us?

1476
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,761
Have you considered

1477
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,041
a mandatory quarantine on predators?

1478
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,770
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1479
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,440
Uh, that's all the time that we have.

1480
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,766
No more questions.

1481
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,606
Was I okay?

1482
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,887
Oh, you did fine.

1483
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,766
Oh, that went so fast.

1484
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,046
I didn't get a chance to mention you...

1485
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,440
or say anything about how we...

1486
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,926
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1487
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,601
What do you mean?

1488
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,241
"Clearly there's
a biological component?"

1489
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,046
"These predators may be
reverting back...

1490
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,282
"to their primitive, savage ways?"

1491
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,045
Are you serious?

1492
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,727
I just stated the facts of the case.

1493
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,247
I mean, it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1494
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,289
Right. But a fox could, huh?

1495
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,807
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.

1496
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,844
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1497
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,127
Ugh. You know what I mean.

1498
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,685
You're not that kind of predator.

1499
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,331
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1500
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,846
The kind that makes you think...

1501
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,480
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1502
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,761
Yeah, don't think I didn't...

1503
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,366
notice that little item
the first time we met.

1504
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,803
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1505
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,767
Do you think I might go nuts?

1506
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,089
Do you think I might go savage?

1507
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,402
Do you think I might try to...

1508
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,527
eat you?

1509
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,725
I knew it.

1510
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,321
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh.

1511
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,246
Probably best if you don't
have a predator as a partner.

1512
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,168
No. Nick. Nick!

1513
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,289
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

1514
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,130
No, he's my friend.

1515
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,129
We can't even trust our own friends?

1516
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,004
That is not what I said! Please!

1517
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Are we safe?

1518
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,240
Have any of our foxes
gone savage?

1519
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,641
<i>More bad news
in this city gripped by fear.</i>

1520
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,683
<i>A caribou is in critical condition...</i>

1521
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,921
<i>the victim of a mauling...</i>

1522
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,923
<i>by a savage polar bear.</i>

1523
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,600
<i>This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...</i>

1524
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,009
<i>after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence...</i>

1525
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,851
<i>to traditionally predatory animals.</i>

1526
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,889
<i>Meanwhile, a peace rally organized...</i>

1527
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,604
<i>by pop star Gazelle...</i>

1528
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,165
<i>was marred by protest.</i>

1529
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,249
<i>Go back to the forest, predator!</i>

1530
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,970
<i>I'm from the savanna!</i>

1531
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,003
<i>Zootopia is a unique place.</i>

1532
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,602
<i>It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...</i>

1533
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,161
<i>where we celebrate our differences.</i>

1534
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,725
<i>This is not the Zootopia I know.</i>

1535
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,369
<i>The Zootopia I know
is better than this.</i>

1536
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,768
<i>We don't just blindly assign blame.</i>

1537
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,128
<i>We don't know why these
attacks keep happening...</i>

1538
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,889
<i>but it is irresponsible...</i>

1539
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,247
<i>to label all predators as savages.</i>

1540
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,728
That's not my Emmitt.

1541
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,641
<i>We cannot let fear divide us.</i>

1542
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,368
<i>Please give me back
the Zootopia I love.</i>

1543
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,925
Come on, Hopps.

1544
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,360
The new mayor wants to see us.

1545
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,887
The mayor? Why?

1546
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,005
It would seem you've arrived.

1547
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,731
Clawhauser?

1548
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,564
What are you doing?

1549
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,921
Um...

1550
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,329
They thought it would be better...

1551
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,722
if a predator such as myself...

1552
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,247
wasn't the first face that you see...

1553
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,568
when you walk into the ZPD.

1554
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,290
What?

1555
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,445
They're gonna move me to records.

1556
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,567
It's downstairs.

1557
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,083
It's by the boiler.

1558
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,725
Hopps!

1559
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,085
Um, I don't understand.

1560
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,244
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

1561
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,926
and right now
they're just really scared.

1562
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,610
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1563
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,770
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I...

1564
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,089
want you to be
the public face of the ZPD.

1565
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,611
I'm... not...

1566
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,290
I'm not a hero.

1567
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,488
I came here to make
the world a better place...

1568
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,210
but I think I broke it.

1569
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,365
Don't give yourself
so much credit, Hopps.

1570
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,000
The world has always been broken...

1571
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,122
that's why we need good cops.

1572
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,801
Like you.

1573
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,321
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

1574
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,803
is supposed to serve and protect.

1575
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,122
Help the city.

1576
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,887
Not tear it apart.

1577
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,602
I don't deserve this badge.

1578
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,806
Hopps...

1579
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,083
Judy, you've worked
so hard to get here.

1580
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,687
It's what you wanted
since you were a kid.

1581
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,644
You can't quit.

1582
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,809
Thank you for the opportunity.

1583
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,765
A dozen carrots.

1584
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,080
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

1585
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,321
Come on.

1586
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,842
Hey, there, Jude. Jude the dude.

1587
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,844
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1588
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,161
I'm fine.

1589
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,607
You are not fine.
Your ears are droopy.

1590
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,123
Why did I think
I could make a difference?

1591
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,044
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1592
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,884
You've always been a trier.

1593
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,286
Oh, I tried.

1594
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,522
And it made life so much worse...

1595
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,404
for so many innocent predators.

1596
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,721
Oh, not all of them, though.

1597
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,921
Speak of the devil.

1598
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,201
Right on time.

1599
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,051
Is that Gideon Grey?

1600
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,203
Yep. It sure is.
We work with him now.

1601
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,527
He's our partner.

1602
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,567
And we never
would have considered it...

1603
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,767
had you not opened our minds.

1604
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,840
That's right.

1605
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,126
I mean, Gid's turned into one of...

1606
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,920
the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1607
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,730
That's...

1608
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,611
That's really cool, you guys.

1609
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,440
Gideon Grey.

1610
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,081
I'll be darned.

1611
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,487
Hey, Judy. I'd just like
to say I'm sorry...

1612
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,642
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1613
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,129
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself...

1614
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,328
in the form of unchecked rage
and aggression.

1615
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,642
I was a major jerk.

1616
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,242
Oh, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.

1617
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,966
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

1618
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,840
Hey, kids, don't you run through...

1619
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,325
<i>that midnicampum holicithias.</i>

1620
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1621
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,603
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

1622
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,446
My family always just
called them Night Howlers.

1623
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,365
I'm so... What did you say?

1624
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,240
Oh, Gid's talking about
those flowers, Judy.

1625
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,050
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

1626
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,770
but I don't like the little
ones going near 'em...

1627
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,326
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1628
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,449
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids...

1629
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,641
and went completely nuts.

1630
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,127
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1631
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,601
A bunny can go savage.

1632
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,803
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.

1633
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,160
But it did hurt like the devil.

1634
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,321
Well, sure it did!

1635
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,004
There's a sizable divot in your arm.

1636
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,445
I'd call that savage.

1637
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,803
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

1638
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,486
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

1639
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,687
That's it!

1640
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,171
That's what I've been missing!

1641
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,881
Oh, keys!

1642
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,280
Keys. keys, keys! Hurry!
Come on!

1643
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,967
Oh! Thank you! I love you! Bye!

1644
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,521
You catch any of that, Bon?

1645
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,841
Not one bit.

1646
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,485
Oh, that makes me
feel a little bit better.

1647
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,642
I thought she was talking
in tongues or something.

1648
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,564
Who is it?

1649
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I need to find Nick.

1650
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,531
Please.

1651
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,841
Nick?

1652
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,846
Nick!

1653
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,005
Oh, Nick.

1654
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,049
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

1655
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,924
They're toxic flowers.

1656
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,244
I think someone is targeting
predators on purpose...

1657
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,721
and making them go savage!

1658
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,406
Wow.

1659
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,523
Isn't that interesting?

1660
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,126
Wait... Wait! Listen...

1661
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,691
I know you'll never forgive me!

1662
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,927
And I don't blame you.

1663
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,890
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

1664
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,561
And irresponsible and small-minded.

1665
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,566
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.

1666
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,443
I have to fix this.

1667
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,281
But I can't do it without you.

1668
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,325
And after we're done...

1669
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,244
you can hate me.

1670
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,886
And... And that'll be fine.

1671
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,329
Because I was a horrible friend...

1672
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,925
and I hurt you...

1673
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:09,571
and you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

1674
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,725
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1675
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,281
<i>I really am
just a dumb bunny.</i>

1676
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,209
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1677
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,330
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

1678
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,601
in 48 hours.

1679
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,886
All right. Get in here.

1680
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,805
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.

1681
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,401
There we go. Deep breath.

1682
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,602
Are you just trying to steal the pen?

1683
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,290
Is that what this is?

1684
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,123
You are standing on my tail,
though. Off, off, off, off...

1685
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1686
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,811
Ooh, I thought you guys
only grew carrots.

1687
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,689
Mmm. What's the plan?

1688
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,524
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1689
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,966
Okay. How?

1690
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,446
Know this guy?

1691
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,008
Uh-huh. I told you.
I know everybody.

1692
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,450
Well, hello. Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

1693
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,131
All your favorite movies!

1694
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,806
I got movies that haven't
even been released yet.

1695
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,484
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

1696
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,327
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

1697
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,720
What's it to you, Wilde?

1698
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,171
Shouldn't you be melting down
a popsicle or something?

1699
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,760
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.

1700
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,644
We both know those
weren't moldy onions...

1701
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,006
I caught you stealing.

1702
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,320
What were you gonna do with...

1703
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,441
those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

1704
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,528
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

1705
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,529
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1706
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,848
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1707
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,520
Ice him.

1708
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,001
You dirty rat!

1709
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,161
Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1710
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,569
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

1711
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,643
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1712
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,171
Oh.

1713
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,846
Ice this weasel.

1714
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,360
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

1715
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,890
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

1716
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,844
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

1717
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Money.

1718
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,049
And to whom did you sell them?

1719
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,480
A ram named Doug.

1720
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,090
We got a drop spot underground.

1721
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,321
<i>Just watch it.</i>

1722
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,204
<i>Doug is the opposite of friendly.</i>

1723
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,845
<i>He's unfriendly.</i>

1724
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,365
Come On.

1725
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,924
The weasel wasn't lying.

1726
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,611
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered...

1727
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,125
the market on Night Howlers.

1728
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,650
You got Doug here.

1729
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,768
What's the mark?

1730
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,170
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1731
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,970
You serious?
Yeah, I know they're fast.

1732
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,281
I can hit him.

1733
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,482
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter...

1734
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,240
through the open window
of a moving car.

1735
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,482
Yeah, I'll buzz you
when it's done.

1736
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,681
Or you'll see it on the news.

1737
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,171
You know, whichever comes first.

1738
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,648
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1739
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,201
All right. Woolter and Jesse
are back, so I'm leaving now.

1740
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,521
Out.

1741
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,170
Hey. Where are you going?
Get back here!

1742
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,203
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1743
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,200
What are you looking at? Hey!

1744
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,607
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

1745
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,681
Carrots!

1746
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,003
It better have
the extra foam this time.

1747
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,281
Hey, open up!

1748
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,681
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

1749
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,570
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD!

1750
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,730
Okay. Great! Here it is. Got it!

1751
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,849
- No. All of it!
- Wait, what?

1752
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,160
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?

1753
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,691
Hey, listen. It would take a miracle...

1754
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,165
to get this rust-bucket going.

1755
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,849
Well. Hallelujah.

1756
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,487
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

1757
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,210
Oh, it just got worse!

1758
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,206
Mission accomplished.

1759
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,367
Would it be premature for me...

1760
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,840
to do a little victory toot-toot?

1761
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,366
All right. One toot-toot.

1762
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,246
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

1763
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,691
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.

1764
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,885
Maybe that's just hail.

1765
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,526
Come here!

1766
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,926
Back off! Oh!

1767
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,887
Whoa!

1768
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,121
Incoming!

1769
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,761
Carrots!

1770
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,365
Don't stop! Keep going!

1771
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,800
No, no! Please stop!

1772
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,769
Do not stop this car!

1773
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,401
Whoa!

1774
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,961
Oh!

1775
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,446
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

1776
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,920
There's another train coming!

1777
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,730
Trust me. Speed up!

1778
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,966
Stop the train!

1779
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,960
Hey!

1780
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,644
Need some help?

1781
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,525
Oh, no, no, no!
Too fast! Too fast!

1782
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,601
Hold on!

1783
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,920
Ahh!

1784
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,764
I think this is our stop!

1785
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,331
Okay, maybe some
of the evidence survived.

1786
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,487
Oh!

1787
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,365
Everything is gone.

1788
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,841
We've lost it all.

1789
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,007
Yeah...

1790
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,885
Oh, except for this.

1791
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,811
- Ow.
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!

1792
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,048
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1793
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,888
Cut through
the Natural History Museum!

1794
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,607
There it is!

1795
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,681
Judy!

1796
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,845
Judy!

1797
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,849
Mayor Bellwether!

1798
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,320
We found out what's happening.

1799
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,169
Someone's darting
predators with a serum.

1800
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,203
That's what's making them go savage.

1801
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,250
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

1802
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:47,687
Thank you, ma'am.

1803
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,083
How did you know where to find us?

1804
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,049
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.

1805
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,526
Uh, you know what?

1806
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:00,321
I think Nick and I will just
take this to the ZPD.

1807
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,047
Run.

1808
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,571
Get them.

1809
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,447
Ahh!

1810
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,121
Carrots!

1811
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,690
I got you!

1812
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,245
Come here, come here.

1813
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,448
Okay, now just relax.

1814
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,768
Whoops... Blueberry?

1815
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,041
Pass.

1816
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,922
Come on out, Judy.

1817
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,366
Take the case.

1818
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,607
Get it to Bogo.

1819
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,530
I'm not gonna leave you
behind. That's not happening.

1820
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,966
I can't walk.

1821
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,201
Just... We'll think of something.

1822
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,647
We're on the same team, Judy.

1823
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,771
Underestimated, underappreciated.

1824
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,082
Aren't you sick of it?

1825
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,601
Predators.
They may be strong and loud...

1826
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,441
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1827
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,161
Think of it.

1828
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,289
90% of the population...

1829
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,642
united against a common enemy.

1830
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,288
We'll be unstoppable.

1831
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,927
Huh?

1832
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,805
Over there!

1833
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,641
Help!

1834
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,646
Well, you should have just stayed...

1835
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,086
on the carrot farm, huh?

1836
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,800
It really is too bad.
I... I did like you.

1837
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,526
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1838
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,643
No, of course not.

1839
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,841
He is.

1840
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,005
No! Oh, Nick!

1841
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,286
Yes, police! There's a savage fox...

1842
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,129
in the Natural History Museum.

1843
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,448
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

1844
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,008
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

1845
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,121
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?

1846
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,567
Since preds are just biologically...

1847
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,802
predisposed to be savages.

1848
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,686
Gosh. Think of the headline!

1849
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,851
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."

1850
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,043
So that's it? Prey fears predator...

1851
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,690
and you stay in power?

1852
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,405
Yeah, pretty much.

1853
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,687
It won't work!

1854
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,361
Fear always works.

1855
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,846
And I'll dart every predator...

1856
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,724
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1857
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,921
Oh, Nick.

1858
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,726
No.

1859
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,565
Bye-bye, bunny.

1860
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,007
Bleh...

1861
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,244
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

1862
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,720
All right, you know, you're milking it.

1863
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,160
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

1864
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,641
We got it up there,
thank you, Yakety-yak!

1865
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,450
You laid it all out beautifully.

1866
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,640
What?

1867
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,320
Yeah... Oh, are you
looking for the serum?

1868
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,561
Well, it's right here.

1869
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,200
What you've got in the weapon there?

1870
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,647
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

1871
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,763
They are delicious.
You should try some.

1872
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:21,248
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you, too.

1873
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,761
It's my word against yours.

1874
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,969
Ooh, actually...

1875
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,690
<i>And I'll dart every predator...</i>

1876
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,251
<i>in Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

1877
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,280
...it's your word against yours.

1878
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

1879
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,965
<i>Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...</i>

1880
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,284
<i>guilty of masterminding
the savage attacks...</i>

1881
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,448
<i>that have plagued Zootopia of late.</i>

1882
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,449
<i>Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart...</i>

1883
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,170
<i>denies any knowledge of her plot...</i>

1884
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,641
<i>claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.</i>

1885
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,287
<i>Did I falsely imprison those animals?</i>

1886
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,686
<i>Well, yes. Yes, I did.</i>

1887
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,849
<i>It was a classic
"doing the wrong thing...</i>

1888
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,650
<i>"for the right reason" kind of a deal.</i>

1889
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,530
<i>In related news, doctors say...</i>

1890
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,961
<i>the Night Howler antidote
is proving effective...</i>

1891

1892

Emmitt.

1893
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,967
Oh, Emmitt.

1894
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,767
Thank you.

1895
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,370
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

1896
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,161
<i>...l thought Zootopia
was this perfect place.</i>

1897
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,809
<i>Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.</i>

1898
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,240
<i>Turns out...</i>

1899
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,120
<i>real life's a little bit
more complicated...</i>

1900
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,851
<i>than a slogan on a bumper sticker.</i>

1901
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,769
<i>Real life is messy.</i>

1902
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:50,162
<i>We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.</i>

1903
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,369
<i>Which means, hey, glass half-full...</i>

1904
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,767
<i>we all have a lot in common.</i>

1905
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,731
<i>And the more we try
to understand one another...</i>

1906
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,850
<i>the more exceptional
each of us will be.</i>

1907
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,683
<i>But we have to try.</i>

1908
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,566
<i>So, no matter what type
of animal you are...</i>

1909
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,210
<i>from the biggest elephant...</i>

1910
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,731
<i>to our first fox...</i>

1911
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,051
<i>I implore you... Try.</i>

1912
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:21,687
<i>Try to make the world a better place.</i>

1913
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,367
<i>Look inside yourself...</i>

1914
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,210
<i>and recognize that change...</i>

1915

1916
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,885
<i>It starts with me.</i>

1917
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,202
<i>It starts with all of us.</i>

1918
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,290
All right. All right, enough! Shut it!

1919
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,326
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

1920
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,721
including our first fox.

1921
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,885
Who cares?

1922
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,246
Huh, you should have your own line...

1923
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,401
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1924
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,801
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1925
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,850
Assignments.

1926
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,560
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato...

1927
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,571
Tundratown SWAT.

1928
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,888
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

1929
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,929

1930
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,606

Parking duty.

1932
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,004
Dismissed.

1933
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,924
Just kidding!

1934
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,764
We have reports of a street racer...

1935
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,251
