1
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:57,492
- There you go.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:15,420
I'm gonna be a dad!

3
00:01:15,637 --> 00:01:18,840
I just talked to my wife. My
baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

4
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:21,767
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

5
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,722
Congratulate me.

6
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,147
Good for you, Herb.

7
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,026
Don't even think about it.

8
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:34,065
Hey!

9
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:38,618
Sorry. How are you? Nice to see
you. I'm gonna be a dad!

10
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,404
Congrats!

11
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,536
Hey, Mr. Nuts, did
you hear the news?

12
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,366
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

13
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,376
I'm here. I'm here.

14
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:52,797
- I'm here.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,757
You missed the delivery.

16
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,754
It's okay. Making
the baby's the fun part.

17
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:22,324
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong...

18
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:26,038
No, I don't need
to see the directions.

19
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:43,222
Push, push.

20
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,010
Push!

21
00:02:57,697 --> 00:03:00,022
Twelve hours of labor.

22
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,033
Oh, but it was worth it.

23
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,408
Look at him. Look at him.

24
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,993
Rodney Copperbottom.

25
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,662
He's got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

26
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,159
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

27
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:15,587
This Copperbottom will do great
things for the world, I can feel it.

28
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:17,085
- Honey?
- What?

29
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,334
What's that extra piece?

30
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,881
Oh, no, they always
put in an extra...

31
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:25,799
We did want a boy, right?

32
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:30,934
This won't hurt a bit, son.

33
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:40,445
Got your nose. Got your nose.

34
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,317
Got your...

35
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,678
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big-boy parts?

36
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,473
They sure are.

37
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:12,054
They're not shiny.

38
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:15,937
Well, they're not brand-new.
They're preowned. So...

39
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,816
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

40
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,572
And they're only for a year.

41
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,259
Hey, Dad, who's that?

42
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,760
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

43
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,102
The greatest robot in the world.

44
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:58,232
I thought you were the greatest
robot in the world.

45
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,026
No, besides me.

46
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,021
He's the head
of Bigweld Industries.

47
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:05,358
He invents things that make
everyone's life better.

48
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,576
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.

49
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,115
- Dad?
- Yeah?

50
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:14,072
- What do you do?
- Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

51
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,617
I'm a dishwasher.

52
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:25,417
<i>And now, live from Robot
City, it's The Bigweld Show.</i>

53
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:29,013
Oh, yeah!

54
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:32,219
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

55
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,884
All right, Rodney. All right,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

56
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:37,435
I had to bring work home
with me again, I'm sorry.

57
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,564
Mr. Gunk has really
been piling it on.

58
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:43,684
<i>And now, the host
of our show, Bigweld.</i>

59
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:48,359
<i>Welcome. This week I thought you'd like to take
a look around Bigweld Industries.</i>

60
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:52,526
<i>This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain't it?</i>

61
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,832
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

62
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,084
Tim, who closed the front gate?

63
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:02,538
Well, I just thought since...

64
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:05,623
We never shut the gate, Tim.

65
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:09,010
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

66
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,802
See, every day, robots come
here from hither and yon...

67
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,181
bringing us new ideas.

68
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:18,473
And I listen to every single
one of them.

69
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,360
So remember, whether a bot is made of new
parts, old parts or spare parts...

70
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,285
you can shine no matter
what you're made of.

71
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,534
He's talking to me, Dad.

72
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,575
He sure is, son. He sure is.

73
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:40,165
<i>Okay, folks, let's get
to inventing.</i>

74
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,132
<i>You know, I love to tinker...</i>

75
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:51,419
<i>but all the tinkering in the world isn't
useful unless it starts with a good idea.</i>

76
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:59,014
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

77
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,889
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

78
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:08,312
you've done it. See
a need, fill a need.

79
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:11,983
That's it, Dad.
I have to look for...

80
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,240
a need.

81
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,422
Easy, now.

82
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:49,022
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.

83
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:52,156
These are your 12-year-old
parts. They're...

84
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,988
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

85
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,245
- I don't mind.
- They are from your cousin...

86
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,867
Veronica.

87
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,662
You know how popular she is.

88
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,271
Thanks.

89
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,377
Oh, hey. Hey.

90
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:50,418
Soon as you reach the age where your warranty
expires, you start falling apart.

91
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:53,124
Pretty soon there's gonna
be more duct tape than me.

92
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:56,672
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...

93
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,887
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.

94
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:03,095
I invented it for you.

95
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:07,809
Okay. Let's try it.

96
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:10,730
Great. Okay, this is it.

97
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:14,438
Wonderbot, go to work.

98
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,789
Yeah, yeah.

99
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:40,714
Hey!

100
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,213
Copperbottom!

101
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,751
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?

102
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:15,794
- Oh, that. My son made it.
- What's it doing?

103
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,960
Mr. Gunk, please, you're
making it nervous.

104
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,470
It's wrecking my kitchen!

105
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,175
- I'll stop it.
- No!

106
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,228
Your son, huh?

107
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,815
It wasn't his fault. He had
nothing to do with it.

108
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:36,478
Yes, sir, he's a brilliant
boy. An inventor.

109
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:40,695
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

110
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,239
Inventor.

111
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:46,160
You're the hand-me-down son of a dishwasher,
and that's all you'll ever be.

112
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:50,875
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

113
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:53,333
<i>Roundtrip or one-way?</i>

114
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,422
One-way.

115
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:01,677
There you are. I told
you I'd find him.

116
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:05,431
- It's a mother's instinct.
- Instinct? He left us a note:

117
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:08,057
"I'm leaving. I'll be
at the train station."

118
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,892
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

119
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:15,354
No, Mom. I have to do this. I'm
going to Robot City tonight.

120
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:18,446
I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

121
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:19,985
Talk to him.

122
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,993
- Ro...
- Robot City? You're just a kid.

123
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,279
I'm never gonna be someone here.

124
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:28,160
I wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

125
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,743
I wanna be somebody.

126
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,418
You are somebody.

127
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,911
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

128
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,665
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.

129
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:43,347
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?

130
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:46,676
- Not me. Him.
- But...

131
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:51,519
Rodney, did you know that when
I was your age, I wanted to be a musician?

132
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,229
I played pretty well too...

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,401
but my dad was worried I wouldn't
be able to make a living.

134
00:11:57,612 --> 00:12:01,526
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I'm not complaining.

135
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,736
But I've always
said to myself...

136
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:10,120
if I could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

137
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,415
You've got greatness
in you, Rodney.

138
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,128
Never doubt it.

139
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,212
You go to Robot City.

140
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:21,711
You go meet Bigweld, and you
show him your big ideas.

141
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,215
And, Rodney...

142
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:27,220
never, never give up.

143
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:45,237
All aboard.

144
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,657
Mom.

145
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:05,001
I won't let you down, Dad.

146
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,590
I'll make you proud.

147
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,678
I know you will.

148
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,904
Excuse me, I wonder if...

149
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:06,900
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...

150
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,151
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust...?

151
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,699
- What?
- Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

152
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,152
Fifty bucks? For what?

153
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,952
A beautiful picture of your first
moment in Robot City.

154
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,284
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

155
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,294
Are you keeping track?

156
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on, work with me, work
with me. More pout, less pose.

157
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:27,134
Great. Inside of you is a fashion
model waiting to throw up.

158
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,679
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big
eyes. Give me big anime eyes.

159
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,177
- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don't want any pictures.

160
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:36,770
- You don't?
- No.

161
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:40,805
That's all right. There's no film. Would
you like a map to the stars' homes?

162
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:42,692
Where did he go?

163
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:05,792
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don't buy us, we're fakes.

164
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,669
Next.

165
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:19,927
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

166
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,434
Oh, great...

167
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,361
Never mind.

168
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:42,292
Hi, excuse me. How do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

169
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,174
What?

170
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:52,720
Yeah, thanks.

171
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:55,214
<i>Cross-town express
to Foundry District...</i>

172
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,262
<i>with stops at Bigweld Industries
and Battery Park only.</i>

173
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:03,475
<i>Please tighten all spools, nuts,
bolts and detachable appendages.</i>

174
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,730
<i>Riders with high oil pressure
are advised to take the local.</i>

175
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,821
<i>Thank you, and have
a nice day.</i>

176
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,166
No, no.

177
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:34,753
- Say, are you following me?
- No.

178
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:37,766
- First time on the cross-town express?
- Well, actually, I...

179
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,262
Oh, boy.

180
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:43,060
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

181
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:47,021
And if you can't make it
here, welcome to the club.

182
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,239
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

183
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,327
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

184
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,911
- What?
- I don't wanna die.

185
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:15,967
I was just kidding. Just put
your head between your legs.

186
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,479
Yeah!

187
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,273
There goes my stop.

188
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:53,085
I tell you, the things that fall
off me... It's embarrassing.

189
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,690
Sorry.

190
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:31,293
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...

191
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,089
Oh, they brought it back.

192
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,065
Stick with me. I know this
town like the back of my hand.

193
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:01,567
Hey, that's new.

194
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,972
Excuse me. Can I help you?

195
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:27,845
Sorry, I...

196
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:33,020
- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
- That's me.

197
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,563
Well, hey, Tim.

198
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:37,606
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be...

199
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,156
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

200
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,114
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

201
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:46,038
I'm an inventor.

202
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,781
Oh, why didn't you say so?

203
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,077
Stand back.

204
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,437
Thanks.

205
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:13,142
What?

206
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,810
I got you. You see, because you
were all excited and then, boom!

207
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,572
All right, I had
my laugh. Go on in.

208
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,656
Now, that's funny.

209
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,617
The second time.

210
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:36,206
You really think I'm gonna
let you in. But I'm not.

211
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:39,258
Sorry, kid, nobody gets
in. Company rules.

212
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:42,634
Company ru...? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

213
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,171
They don't. Those days are over.

214
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:49,559
My advice: Come back two years
ago. Then the job is yours.

215
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:07,990
So remember, whether a bot is made of new
parts, old parts or spare parts...

216
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:10,529
you can shine no matter
what you're made of.

217
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,242
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

218
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,337
Concern for the common robot.

219
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:22,842
You don't come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

220
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,553
And for good reason.

221
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,630
There's no money in it!

222
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:30,638
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

223
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:33,936
That's why old fat face no
longer sits in the big chair.

224
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,599
He's a relic.

225
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:40,062
So I don't wanna hear
another, "Where's Bigweld?"

226
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:46,070
We'll see him next month at the Bigweld
Ball. He always goes to that.

227
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:52,411
Now, let's get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

228
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:55,583
out of Mr. And
Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

229
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,497
What's our big-ticket item?

230
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,883
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

231
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,632
That's how we make the dough.

232
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:13,599
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're "fine"...

233
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,221
how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

234
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,020
to buy our upgrades and make
themselves look better?

235
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:23,686
Therefore, I've come
up with a new slogan.

236
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:27,488
"Why be you when
you can be new?"

237
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:32,949
I gotta tell you, I think
it's brilliant...

238
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:39,208
but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

239
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,500
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

240
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,012
Just don't look down.

241
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:02,223
Hey.

242
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,772
Get off.

243
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,024
Go on, get off.

244
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,527
Get off of...

245
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:14,414
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

246
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:18,448
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.

247
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,577
- But...
- But?

248
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:24,745
I'm just wondering, why
would robots buy new upgrades...

249
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:27,594
if parts are so much cheaper?

250
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,049
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

251
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:35,216
Because as of today, we are no
longer making spare parts.

252
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:39,563
Do you know what I call robots who can't
afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

253
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,934
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

254
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:47,860
They turn your insides out. You
wanna run home and scrub yourself.

255
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,985
Now, Cappy, I want your department
to push our new slogan.

256
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,036
In fact, I'm moving you
into the office right next to mine.

257
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:57,738
We'll be working very, very
closely together on this one.

258
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,992
- Won't that be fun?
- Oodles.

259
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,297
- Oh, so sorry, I...
- What the...?

260
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:20,850
Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

261
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:24,433
and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

262
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,269
Who doesn't seem to be here.

263
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:31,024
Gee, no, no. But while he's away,
he left me in charge.

264
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:33,992
Oh, well, then let me show
you what this can do.

265
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:39,868
I have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

266
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,369
It can do this!

267
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:05,065
So how did it go?

268
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:11,520
What the heck is going
on around here?

269
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:16,276
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

270
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:21,028
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

271
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:25,460
Listen, I'll be back, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of this.

272
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,706
When you pick a lost
cause, you really commit.

273
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:32,582
Where do they make dreamers
like you? Get lost, freak!

274
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:42,046
All right, break time.

275
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,349
All right, break time's over.

276
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,312
Chop-chop.

277
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:53,269
Look who's here.

278
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:57,316
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

279
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,824
Great. I did just what you
told me. No more spare parts.

280
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:06,121
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

281
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,166
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

282
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,083
Such a good boy.

283
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,912
And after you finish
off Bigweld...

284
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:15,246
there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

285
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:17,457
Exactly!

286
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:19,668
You wanna swing
that one by me again?

287
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:23,171
Idiot! Those outmodes
look up to him.

288
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:26,924
- Suppose he decides to come back?
- Oh, come on, Mom.

289
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:30,512
- He's not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?

290
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,017
Grow some bolts.

291
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,687
Or do you want to end
up like your father?

292
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:37,273
Hey, son. Good to see you.

293
00:28:37,487 --> 00:28:38,946
Think what it would mean.

294
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:43,989
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

295
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,489
Keep talking.

296
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:48,283
Ratchet City!

297
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:51,492
Yes, everything shiny.

298
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:55,617
No more Bigweld,
no more outmode.

299
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:57,624
Let's do it!

300
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,875
That's my boy!

301
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,973
Are you hungry? Can
I get you something?

302
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:14,059
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

303
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:15,394
Bye, Pop.

304
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:18,609
So long, son. Good luck
with your dastardly plans.

305
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:44,510
Hey.

306
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:46,762
Hi there.

307
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:52,934
Listen, if I seem to be getting
smaller, it's because I'm leaving.

308
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,855
Foot, don't fail me now.

309
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:58,065
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

310
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:44,154
Oh, great. Happy now?

311
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:47,567
Not until you give me
back my foot, you mugger.

312
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:51,532
I am not a mugger.
I happen to be...

313
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:52,784
a scrounger.

314
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:55,323
I didn't know you were
at the end of that foot.

315
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,825
Here, let me help you with that.

316
00:30:58,044 --> 00:30:59,538
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

317
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,835
I have my pride, you
know. Over here.

318
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:05,541
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

319
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:07,426
No. No, no.

320
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:13,183
What's the use?
There's nothing left.

321
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:17,016
Hey, Diesel, I found
you a voice box.

322
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:27,984
Here's another one.

323
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,907
That's no good. Give me that.

324
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,829
I can never find
parts in my size.

325
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,668
What is it, boy?

326
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:45,914
Hey, Fender, have
you lost weight?

327
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:48,132
Lost weight?

328
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:51,672
Look at where you're looking.
He's a head in a basket.

329
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:54,090
We're doomed, I knew
it. We're doomed.

330
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,306
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic
nut? Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

331
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:02,015
Wow, speak of the devil,
here I come.

332
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:04,349
Dang!

333
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:07,107
Check this out.

334
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:10,940
Who would throw away such
a cute little doodad?

335
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,952
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, that's mine.

336
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,532
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

337
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:20,578
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

338
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:22,830
He's over there, moron.

339
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,329
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

340
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:28,258
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.

341
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:32,424
If you think you can mess with my big
brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

342
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:35,219
Piper, would you
behave yourself.

343
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:38,179
Now, come on, let's get
Fender fixed. Again.

344
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,885
Here's your thingamabob.

345
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:43,306
By the way, the name's Piper.

346
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,641
Rhymes with "viper."

347
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,611
See you around.

348
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:55,568
We've told you a hundred times:

349
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,951
"Don't talk to strange
men." Thank you, Manuel.

350
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:01,248
I talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

351
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:11,585
I got good news,
and I got bad news.

352
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,175
- What's the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.

353
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:17,681
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

354
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,472
You have been officially
outmoded.

355
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,229
Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

356
00:33:22,397 --> 00:33:23,974
What's the good news?!

357
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,982
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

358
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:38,287
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

359
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:42,410
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

360
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,629
That new-upgrade smell.

361
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,411
Just came in, fully
loaded. Look.

362
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:51,625
It's got cup-holders, standard.

363
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:53,254
Does it come in plus sizes?

364
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:58,090
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

365
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:04,014
I can't afford that fancy stuff. All
I need is one stinking neck joint.

366
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:07,474
No. Why did this happen to me?

367
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:12,484
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

368
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:16,196
Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

369
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,117
The chop shop?

370
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:22,031
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look, no hands.

371
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:28,409
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

372
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,334
- No one's going to the chop shop.
- That's right.

373
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:33,417
What do you think
we can get for him?

374
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,048
Will you stop? Listen,
shiny pants...

375
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:38,753
you get back there and find
a part for my brother.

376
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:43,428
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

377
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,104
I'm sorry. I don't
have the parts.

378
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:50,358
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

379
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,021
I can fix you easy.

380
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:57,572
The Force is strong
with this one.

381
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,544
When was the last
time you got oiled?

382
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,169
I can't answer
that with my kid sister here.

383
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:14,669
Can it, Fender.

384
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:17,256
Hold still. This might tickle.

385
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:19,386
We haven't been properly
introduced.

386
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,554
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

387
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:24,215
but had to change it when
we came in to the country.

388
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:26,054
Copperbottom, Rodney
Copperbottom.

389
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:29,355
Riddle me this: Why did
I meet you among the garbage?

390
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:32,103
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

391
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:37,020
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

392
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,948
He cared about bots like us.

393
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:42,362
I heard they've done him in and left
the rest of us to fall apart.

394
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:45,244
Well, that ought to do it.

395
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:49,080
Look at that! And
he fixed my neck.

396
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,161
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?

397
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,872
Make yourself scarce.

398
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:01,335
What's the big deal?

399
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:05,382
- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.

400
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,890
They sweep you up and take
you to the chop shop.

401
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:12,689
Where they melt you down and turn
you into something else.

402
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:14,650
You mean...?

403
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,850
Yep.

404
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,405
Sweepers. Sweepers.

405
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,318
Help. Here's one outmode
you're not gonna get.

406
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,827
Fender, run!

407
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,544
That was close.

408
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,257
When in Robot City, guests
of the Rusties... That's us.

409
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,182
- Stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding
house, where our motto is:

410
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,805
"Beats rusting outside."

411
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:52,230
Let me just let her know
you're here. Aunt Fanny!

412
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,013
- We brought someone.
- I'm in the kitchen.

413
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:58,229
- Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
- Relax, she's not my aunt.

414
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:02,354
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

415
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,615
Well, then why
is she called Aunt Fanny?

416
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:06,410
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

417
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,619
Oh, crap.

418
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,453
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

419
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:16,582
The artsy's okay, but when
she gets fartsy...

420
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,329
Look at... Oh,
right on my shoes.

421
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,051
I'm so clumsy.

422
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:24,303
Well, hello there.
What's your name?

423
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:25,759
I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

424
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:29,016
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

425
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:32,846
That's a wonderful
name, Bigbottom.

426
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,560
Well, I just...

427
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,522
- What happened to your friend?
- He's been rear-ended.

428
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:43,654
Oh, there you are.

429
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:47,370
Aunt Fanny, he needs
a place to stay.

430
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:50,158
Well, just make
yourself at home.

431
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:52,371
Thank you. That's very
kind of you.

432
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,953
My pleasure.

433
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:55,829
See a need, fill a need.

434
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:57,623
Hey, just like Bigweld.

435
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,959
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

436
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,968
Come on. You can bunk with me.

437
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:08,012
We'll ignore the gossip.

438
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,224
You missed a spot.

439
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,517
Fender, get out of my room!

440
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,063
I'm not in your room.

441
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,443
I am now. Now I'm
not. I am. Not. Am...

442
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:24,606
Get out of my room.

443
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,243
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

444
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:33,659
Sorry.

445
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,662
Here we are. Home sweet home.

446
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,209
What's mine is yours.

447
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:41,959
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get them.

448
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,042
Look at that. Now
they're arm-wrestling.

449
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,929
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

450
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:19,206
I know that sounds bad, but I'm
just doing musical arm farts.

451
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:22,464
You know how to do those?

452
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:26,043
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that's where the skill comes in.

453
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:28,010
I'm real close. Listen.

454
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,804
No, wait.

455
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:31,764
No, wait, wait.

456
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,767
You can't tell me that didn't
sound like a... Like an old man.

457
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:40,188
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

458
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:42,434
Kind of a rough day, huh?

459
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:45,321
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

460
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:47,528
waiting for his brilliant
son to call...

461
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,115
and tell him what a big
success my first day was.

462
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,078
I know it's not your problem.

463
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:55,618
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

464
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,450
What are you, a fortune cookie?

465
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,330
"That's what friends..."

466
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:01,957
You consider me a friend?

467
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,081
Sure, what else
would I consider you?

468
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,962
An embarrassment, a way to rebel
against your parents...

469
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:09,460
a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

470
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:11,346
Let's just stick with friend.

471
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:14,432
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

472
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:16,474
there's another one coming
tomorrow.

473
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:19,479
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

474
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:22,140
Hey, Fender.

475
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:27,397
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

476
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,277
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

477
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,445
This is how a man does it.

478
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,698
You guys are so gross.

479
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:40,910
Besides, this is how you do it.

480
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:44,254
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

481
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:50,752
Aunt Fanny...

482
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,005
we were using our arms.

483
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:55,802
Oh, excuse me.

484
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,846
Lady, please...

485
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:01,518
see a doctor.

486
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:14,534
Breakfast.

487
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:16,203
This will perk everyone up.

488
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:18,696
Some of Aunt
Fanny's fresh-brewed grease.

489
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,248
Yummy!

490
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,866
Careful, it's hot.

491
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:31,501
So, what are you
guys doing today?

492
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:34,253
- We're doing it.
- What about you?

493
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,388
Bigweld's disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

494
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:38,301
That's already been established.

495
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:41,638
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?

496
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,640
- Sure.
- Forget it.

497
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,350
"Never try, never fail." Those
are the words I live by.

498
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,605
Crank, the idol of millions
is gone, and no one seems to care.

499
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,111
There should be
an angry mob out there.

500
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:54,860
What the...?

501
00:41:58,121 --> 00:42:00,113
Wow, that was great,
psychic friend.

502
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,741
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky."

503
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:06,409
Say it. Say it.

504
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:10,498
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

505
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:13,000
Nothing but upgrades
from here on in.

506
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:15,929
But I like myself
just the way I am.

507
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:18,588
- We can't afford upgrades!
- Let's get him!

508
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:21,803
Hey, hey, hey, what are you
doing? Don't throw me.

509
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:24,805
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender's neck?

510
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,641
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

511
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:28,643
Yeah, that kid can help you.

512
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,066
Brace yourself. You're
about to get popular.

513
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,030
Only those with insurance.

514
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:37,199
Oh, I forgot.
Everybody, come on.

515
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:40,032
Parts, man. I need parts.

516
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:42,956
You don't look that... bad.

517
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,706
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!

518
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,123
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you robots?

519
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,546
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

520
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:54,211
Why do you have two noses?

521
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:57,505
One's for showing,
one's for blowing.

522
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,049
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?

523
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:03,676
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.

524
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:07,015
- I can't get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.

525
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,184
Back off, back off.

526
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,063
He's got his own dreams
that won't come true.

527
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:20,160
See a need, fill a need.

528
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:22,114
Wait.

529
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:24,954
Who wants to get fixed?

530
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,418
Thanks, Rodney.
You're number one.

531
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:30,269
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

532
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:41,067
Oh, yeah.

533
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:44,487
I have never felt so relaxed.

534
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:48,992
Say, do you mind giving me a little scratch
between the shoulder blades?

535
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:52,210
There you... Easy, tiger.

536
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:54,038
Hey! Take it easy.

537
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,586
Hey, what are you
trying to do, kill me?

538
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:59,462
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

539
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:02,423
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.

540
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:05,266
I know you don't
like anybody here to see me.

541
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:08,268
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone's fixing them.

542
00:45:08,478 --> 00:45:11,514
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...

543
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:14,359
- and they are laughing at you.
- Who?

544
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,016
And are you sure they're
not laughing with me?

545
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:18,773
Yes.

546
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:22,814
So what if one crazy fanatic
repairs a few outmodes? Who cares?

547
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:26,575
Think. Use those brains I stole
for you. Today, it's one.

548
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:29,747
What about tomorrow, when everybody
gets the idea this is okay?

549
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,703
"We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

550
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,288
We want Bigweld."

551
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:36,455
Then what happens to you?

552
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:38,582
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

553
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:41,759
We've got to find
out who this is and stop him.

554
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,670
Not stop him, crush
him, destroy him.

555
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:50,095
And by the way, I brought you
a little something for your desk.

556
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,773
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.

557
00:46:02,782 --> 00:46:04,940
- A few.
- "A few"?

558
00:46:05,118 --> 00:46:08,238
What did you expect,
Rodney? Bigweld was gone.

559
00:46:08,413 --> 00:46:13,075
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

560
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:15,742
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

561
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,749
I'm not Bigweld. These
robots need parts.

562
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:21,628
Mail call. Mail call.

563
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:24,173
Copperbottom, this
one's from your mom.

564
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:26,421
Oh, is there anything for me?

565
00:46:26,598 --> 00:46:29,349
Oh, I got something for you.

566
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:31,261
That's from my sister.

567
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:32,930
I recognize the handwriting.

568
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:35,223
Is anything wrong?

569
00:46:35,398 --> 00:46:38,849
I'll say. His father's got
one foot in the junkyard...

570
00:46:39,027 --> 00:46:42,692
and if they can't find new parts
for him, he's only got a few miles left.

571
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:45,949
Rodney, are you really
worried about your dad?

572
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,736
Do you wanna go home?

573
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:49,945
Well, if I go home,
I still can't help him.

574
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,694
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

575
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:55,958
He's the only one that can
fix this.

576
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:01,415
He's trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

577
00:47:01,925 --> 00:47:04,925
Bigweld is going...

578
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:06,423
dancing.

579
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:09,632
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

580
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:12,768
You can't have the Bigweld
Ball without Bigweld.

581
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:15,647
Well, that's it, then. I'm
going to the Bigweld Ball.

582
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:17,972
What? That's the fanciest
party of the year.

583
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:19,809
You'll never get past the gate.

584
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,781
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.

585
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:37,160
This is Count Roderick
Von Brokenzipper.

586
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:39,374
Formerly Count Velcro.

587
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,922
Where are the trumpets?

588
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:44,919
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count's arrival.

589
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:48,343
Sorry, Your Grace. Beat
me until you're happy.

590
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:51,929
He's happy. And I'm not
feeling too bad myself.

591
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:55,968
- Let me... You're not on the list.
- We're what?

592
00:47:56,145 --> 00:47:58,055
Once again.

593
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:01,898
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

594
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:03,728
You'll explain
to your superiors...

595
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:08,197
why we were not able to attend
your little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

596
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:10,484
But we're leaving in a huff.

597
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,412
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

598
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,616
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

599
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,834
The count hit you? The
arrogance of some people.

600
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:22,957
I will hit you on his behalf.

601
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:25,417
Thank you, Your Grace.

602
00:48:28,428 --> 00:48:29,970
Okay, let's split up.

603
00:48:30,138 --> 00:48:32,973
If you see Bigweld,
come and find me.

604
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:35,971
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

605
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:39,726
What kind of signal do you want? You
want something kind of subtle, like:

606
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:42,149
Or:

607
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,853
Oh, how about this:

608
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:53,151
Ricola!

609
00:48:53,536 --> 00:48:55,908
Subtle. Let's get to work.

610
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:59,166
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

611
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,792
Yes, sir.

612
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,679
I'll have what he's having.

613
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:26,193
You know, Cappy, it's nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

614
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:30,441
See my more casual,
fun-loving side.

615
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:36,151
Now, where were we?

616
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:39,787
Well, there are never any interesting
men at these parties.

617
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,994
Hello, ladies. Fender Von
Fender at your service.

618
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:45,625
Hi, I'm Loretta...

619
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:47,077
Geargrinder.

620
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:51,753
Anyone dressed as badly as you
are must be an eccentric billionaire.

621
00:49:53,346 --> 00:49:56,217
Ladies and gentlebots, now
coming to the stage...

622
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:58,467
the top bot, the big bolt...

623
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:02,391
who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

624
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:05,814
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

625
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:09,399
where I have the tremendous
honor of introducing...

626
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,737
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

627
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,487
who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

628
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,372
- What?
- He sends his apologies...

629
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:22,112
his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

630
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:25,334
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?

631
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:27,247
What have you done with Bigweld?

632
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:31,499
How come we don't see
him anymore, huh?

633
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:34,837
Okay. Security, we have
a party-crasher.

634
00:50:35,013 --> 00:50:39,260
Yeah, that's right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

635
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:43,763
so that I could tell Bigweld that you
are outmoding millions of bots.

636
00:50:44,314 --> 00:50:47,184
And I know because I spend
all day fixing them.

637
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:48,889
You.

638
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:12,665
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

639
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:14,716
I must fly.

640
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,590
Take him for a drive...

641
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:21,761
and bring me back his exact
weight in paper clips.

642
00:51:23,186 --> 00:51:25,428
- No!
- No?

643
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:28,182
I'll escort him out.

644
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:31,313
You don't wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

645
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:32,980
- Good point.
- When I get back...

646
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:35,230
I'll show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

647
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:37,066
Oh, you.

648
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:39,525
- Get moving.
- What? What are you doing?

649
00:51:39,702 --> 00:51:41,611
Saving your life.

650
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:44,406
- Come on.
- Let him go.

651
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:46,242
Let him go. Let him go.

652
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:48,624
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Get him!

653
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,628
- Fender, let's go.
- You know him?

654
00:51:50,797 --> 00:51:52,457
Fender, wait for me.

655
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:54,674
Wonderbot.

656
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,469
Get out of my way!

657
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:01,798
Hey, Tim, I'd like to see
Mr. Bigweld.

658
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:04,056
Oh, you again.

659
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:09,474
Oh, that was amazing.

660
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:13,065
- So where do we go now?
- I'm taking you to the train station.

661
00:52:13,278 --> 00:52:16,481
- What? No way.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

662
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:18,981
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

663
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:21,649
I'm not leaving
until I find Bigweld.

664
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:23,701
- That's not...
- Can't you take me to him?

665
00:52:26,124 --> 00:52:28,330
I must be out of my mind.

666
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:41,300
<i>Au rservoir, my darling.</i>

667
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:45,889
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

668
00:52:46,102 --> 00:52:49,138
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.

669
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,521
So far, I'm up to four.

670
00:52:52,525 --> 00:52:54,731
You crazy nut boy.

671
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:57,151
Crazy about you.

672
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:13,118
<i>I'm singing in the oil.</i>

673
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:16,581
<i>I'm singing in the oil.</i>

674
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:19,593
<i>After all that work and toil.</i>

675
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:23,628
<i>I'm just slipping in the oil.</i>

676
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:27,175
<i>I know where I've been sent.</i>

677
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:30,803
<i>I'm covered in lubricant.</i>

678
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:33,061
My life has turned around.

679
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:37,182
From now on, I'm a winner!

680
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:40,566
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can't do this.

681
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,234
Help.

682
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:53,124
Okay, we tried.
Let's get out of here.

683
00:53:53,294 --> 00:53:54,836
No, no, no. Something's up.

684
00:53:55,004 --> 00:53:56,997
Look at all these
newspapers and this mail.

685
00:53:57,173 --> 00:54:00,008
Come on. They probably stopped
delivering these years ago.

686
00:54:00,176 --> 00:54:01,801
Paper.

687
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:05,678
Late edition.

688
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,891
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.

689
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,895
Come on. We gotta get
you out of here.

690
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,855
Big, creaky door.

691
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:24,195
Perfect.

692
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,594
Look at this.

693
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,845
This is Bigweld's actual
workshop.

694
00:54:54,022 --> 00:54:56,014
I recognize it
from his old TV show.

695
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,725
Could you keep it down? We're
not supposed to be here.

696
00:55:01,904 --> 00:55:03,363
Do you know what these are?

697
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:06,236
These are Bigweld's original
invention designs.

698
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:09,493
- That's his own writing.
- This is strange.

699
00:55:09,662 --> 00:55:11,987
How come it just
stops in the middle?

700
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:14,204
Look at this.

701
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,993
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

702
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:20,543
Rodney, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

703
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,838
Why are they so dusty?

704
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,918
Wait, don't.

705
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:53,908
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

706
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:31,235
Rodney, what do we do?

707
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:35,076
I don't know. This is kind
of a first for me.

708
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:43,500
- Yeah!
- It's him.

709
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,891
- Who's the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?

710
00:56:56,102 --> 00:57:00,182
Well, considering I'm an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

711
00:57:00,356 --> 00:57:03,108
I'm fantastic. Now,
who the heck are you?

712
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:04,556
I'm Rodney.

713
00:57:04,736 --> 00:57:07,690
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

714
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,693
Come on, let's set them
up again, only bigger.

715
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:13,826
Sir, is this
what you've been working on?

716
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:16,907
This is why no one sees you?

717
00:57:17,498 --> 00:57:20,334
Young man, nobody
likes a chatterbox.

718
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:22,536
But there's a terrible
crisis, Mr. Bigweld.

719
00:57:22,837 --> 00:57:25,043
We need to talk.

720
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:30,337
Son, I've gotta tell you, you're
making a lousy first impression.

721
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:34,841
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan. In
fact, he's an inventor just like you.

722
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:37,055
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.

723
00:57:37,393 --> 00:57:39,552
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

724
00:57:41,522 --> 00:57:45,472
Now, don't be scared. Show
Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

725
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:47,940
Go on. It's okay.

726
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:54,698
Is that what it's supposed
to do?

727
00:57:56,412 --> 00:57:57,990
It gets nervous
under pressure...

728
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:00,744
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

729
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:02,791
- Yes?
- Give up.

730
00:58:02,961 --> 00:58:05,630
What? You're telling me to quit?

731
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,042
I said "give up," but "quit"
works just as good.

732
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:13,175
Is that what you did? Is
that why you're sitting here...

733
00:58:13,346 --> 00:58:16,596
letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

734
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:19,684
Kid, sometimes you just gotta
know when you're licked.

735
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:23,387
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

736
00:58:23,564 --> 00:58:25,059
I used to think so.

737
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:28,560
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

738
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:31,862
With Ratchet, it was making
money that came first.

739
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:36,159
I became old-fashioned,
an outmode.

740
00:58:36,536 --> 00:58:40,119
Go home, kid. If he beat
me, he's gonna beat you.

741
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,623
The world you're looking for no
longer exists. You missed it.

742
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:45,620
Find some other foolish dream.

743
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:48,506
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm very, very...

744
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:51,590
very busy.

745
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:54,427
Yeah, I can see that.

746
00:58:56,556 --> 00:58:59,925
All I ever wanted was to grow
up to be like him.

747
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:13,111
Help. Open the door.

748
00:59:13,281 --> 00:59:15,357
Open the door.

749
00:59:16,993 --> 00:59:18,902
Close the door. Close the door!

750
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:31,840
Wow, look at all these
parts. It's a smorgasbord.

751
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:34,962
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

752
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:36,637
Oh, that's pretty.

753
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:56,194
Okay, Mother, this way.

754
00:59:56,407 --> 00:59:58,364
Let me look, please.
I can't bear it.

755
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:00,991
No peeking, now.
It's a surprise.

756
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:02,532
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

757
01:00:02,705 --> 01:00:04,164
And look.

758
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:07,620
- For me?
- It's got a full tank of gas.

759
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:09,786
If you're ready to mow,
she's ready to go.

760
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:13,047
Has any mother ever
had a better son?

761
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:15,921
By the way, I found
out who's been fixing those outmodes.

762
01:00:16,094 --> 01:00:17,552
So tomorrow, these babies...

763
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,294
are gonna chop him
up along with all his buddies...

764
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:23,842
and every other walking pile
of junk I'm sick of looking at.

765
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:26,847
What's that?

766
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:59,502
This is so wrong.
This is so wrong.

767
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:02,801
Help. Help!

768
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:13,014
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

769
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:18,894
Hi, Mom.

770
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:22,277
Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

771
01:01:22,452 --> 01:01:26,236
<i>- And Dad?
- He's right here. I'll put him on.</i>

772
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:28,952
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

773
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,994
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

774
01:01:31,169 --> 01:01:34,419
Oh, fine, fine. I...

775
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,457
I've just
been a little under the weather.

776
01:01:37,634 --> 01:01:39,673
No, we're just having
a little trouble...

777
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,928
finding your old man
a replacement part, that's all.

778
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:45,891
But let's talk about you. What
kind of work are you doing?

779
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:47,850
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

780
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:50,849
Yeah, I met him, but...

781
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:53,357
What's wrong, son?

782
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:57,065
It's not how we thought
it was, Dad.

783
01:01:57,236 --> 01:02:00,072
It's not... I can't...

784
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,366
I see.

785
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:04,864
- I'm really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.

786
01:02:05,036 --> 01:02:07,823
You could never let
me down, Rodney.

787
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:13,245
Listen, I know it
isn't easy, Rodney...

788
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:15,957
but a dream that you
don't fight for...

789
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:19,713
can haunt you for the rest
of your life.

790
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:22,594
Yeah, Dad.

791
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:25,004
<i>It's up to you, son.</i>

792
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,845
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.

793
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:35,971
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

794
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,728
Free nights and weekends.

795
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:40,310
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

796
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:42,148
Wait.

797
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:45,945
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

798
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:48,740
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

799
01:02:48,913 --> 01:02:50,372
Well, why didn't they?

800
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,457
Oh, they did.

801
01:02:55,628 --> 01:02:57,039
Next time, let's split a cab.

802
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:01,839
Who the heck is she?

803
01:03:02,051 --> 01:03:05,088
I used to have
a figure like that.

804
01:03:05,263 --> 01:03:07,552
Hurry, come on. One
ticket to anywhere.

805
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,433
Fender?

806
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,392
I have a sister.

807
01:03:11,978 --> 01:03:13,852
An ugly sister.

808
01:03:14,063 --> 01:03:16,733
Hey, guess what.
It's the sweepers.

809
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:20,482
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them... What "them"? Us.

810
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:22,480
- To Madame Gasket's chop shop.

811
01:03:22,655 --> 01:03:25,407
- And guess who's really behind it all.
- Ratchet.

812
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:28,108
You don't wanna guess? I ran
all this way in heels.

813
01:03:28,286 --> 01:03:29,828
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.

814
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:32,992
Ratchet! Listen
to me. Listen to me.

815
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:36,831
- We won't last a week.
- Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

816
01:03:37,003 --> 01:03:39,375
- Let's all get on that train.
- Come on.

817
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:42,127
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

818
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,292
- You started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

819
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:47,339
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

820
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:49,589
Well, he won't. It's up to us.

821
01:03:49,807 --> 01:03:52,477
If we don't do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

822
01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:54,393
Come on, let's fight back.

823
01:03:54,604 --> 01:03:56,561
Fighting never solved anything.

824
01:03:56,773 --> 01:03:59,394
Quitting isn't so productive
either. I gotta tell you.

825
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:01,518
It's the big boy.

826
01:04:01,736 --> 01:04:03,776
Oh, be still, my pump.

827
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:06,775
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

828
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,325
You... You are?

829
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:11,613
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

830
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:13,282
- But why?
- I don't know.

831
01:04:13,456 --> 01:04:15,532
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large...

832
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,330
No, no, no. Why are you
gonna help us?

833
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:21,836
Because I wanna grow
up to be like you.

834
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,511
Then let's do it.

835
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,881
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

836
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:37,477
Oh, what a man.

837
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:39,685
Someone get a crane.

838
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:48,989
Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

839
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:52,243
So stop telling me how to kill
Bigweld. I'm doing it today...

840
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:56,575
how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

841
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,546
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.

842
01:05:03,715 --> 01:05:06,170
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

843
01:05:06,384 --> 01:05:08,507
No, no. You stay here...

844
01:05:08,678 --> 01:05:11,714
- and watch Daddy's limo.
- Yes, sir.

845
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:13,758
I'm going inside to kick
some Booty.

846
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:16,140
Hey, you know, your boyfriend
here is a genius.

847
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:17,977
- What?
- Oh, he's not my... He is?

848
01:05:18,146 --> 01:05:19,854
I am?

849
01:05:20,857 --> 01:05:23,312
Thanks for still
believing in me.

850
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:27,689
It's good to be home.
Toodley-oodley!

851
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:39,908
I use the Brazilian wax. It makes
me feel like every day's a fiesta.

852
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:42,077
Tell Mr. Ratchet
his 10:00 is here.

853
01:05:42,253 --> 01:05:43,664
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

854
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:52,256
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

855
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:54,929
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

856
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:00,972
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

857
01:06:01,898 --> 01:06:03,807
No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

858
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,770
- Tell him anything, just don't let him in.
- Ratchet!

859
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:11,231
- I'll cut to the point.
- What happened?

860
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:13,281
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

861
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:15,984
- You're fired!
- Fired? On what grounds?

862
01:06:16,162 --> 01:06:18,285
This company's never
been more profitable.

863
01:06:18,498 --> 01:06:20,289
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

864
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,454
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

865
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:26,545
This job is my life. It
means everything to me.

866
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:28,790
You don't know
what I've done to get here.

867
01:06:29,008 --> 01:06:33,717
The lies I've told. The lives
I've ruined. This isn't helping me.

868
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:36,505
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.

869
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:39,394
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

870
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,387
Okay, what did you wanna say?

871
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,140
That.

872
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:47,022
Oh, my gosh. I'm
as crazy as my mother.

873
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:59,866
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

874
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:01,540
Let go of him.

875
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:05,662
Sure. Listen, kid,
it's over. You lost.

876
01:07:05,878 --> 01:07:09,129
Bigweld is gonna be melted
down into next season's upgrades...

877
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:13,343
along with you, your moronic
coffeepot and Cappy.

878
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:16,422
Such a waste.

879
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:53,542
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

880
01:07:53,718 --> 01:07:56,505
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

881
01:07:56,721 --> 01:07:59,010
I'll take that as a "no."

882
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:13,986
Out of the way!

883
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:17,783
Rodney.

884
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:32,584
<i>Road trip! Road
trip! Road trip!</i>

885
01:08:32,757 --> 01:08:34,382
You guys are so embarrassing.

886
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:38,261
Oh, that's Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

887
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:40,262
I've gotta repair him.

888
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:42,839
Okay, I got your back.

889
01:08:48,564 --> 01:08:51,601
Come on, we've gotta
help Rodney.

890
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:56,155
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.

891
01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:59,407
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

892
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:01,817
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

893
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:05,578
You're the only thing I've got
to leave behind. Goodbye!

894
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:07,207
He's right, Piper.

895
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,664
They're headed for a huge
butt-whupping.

896
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:43,945
Okay, got it!

897
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,077
Rodney, what's going
on? Where are we?

898
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:47,991
It's okay. You're all right.

899
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:11,017
Okay, boys, we got them
right where they want us.

900
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:12,648
Boost me up.

901
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,566
Watch your hands down there.

902
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,812
Rodney! We're here to save you!

903
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,747
How do you think
it's going so far?

904
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:39,712
The plug.

905
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:42,962
Hold on, guys! I gotta
get to the other side.

906
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:15,826
We're out of here!

907
01:11:35,773 --> 01:11:37,433
The chop shop.

908
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,233
- That's it. Game over.
- The game is not over.

909
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:43,606
This is our moment to shine.

910
01:11:43,781 --> 01:11:46,782
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

911
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:51,829
In my case, it's a rare metal.
It's called "afraidium."

912
01:11:51,998 --> 01:11:54,406
It's yellow. It
tastes like chicken.

913
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,954
I didn't know I could do that.

914
01:11:58,171 --> 01:11:59,546
Rodney's right.

915
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:05,088
I am tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

916
01:12:05,261 --> 01:12:06,839
L... I...

917
01:12:07,472 --> 01:12:09,263
I wanna try.

918
01:12:09,474 --> 01:12:10,884
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

919
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:14,344
Yes! I want to try.

920
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,436
Then you're first.

921
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:20,108
First for what?

922
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:24,446
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

923
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:33,620
Gasket, you're a sick,
twisted, evil robot.

924
01:12:33,915 --> 01:12:35,077
I try.

925
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,067
Oh, good.

926
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:10,950
Company.

927
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:15,911
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

928
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:17,832
Who are these losers?

929
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,118
- We, sir...
- I'm a woman.

930
01:13:20,336 --> 01:13:21,795
Ouch.

931
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:24,668
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

932
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:27,961
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

933
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:31,386
that you scorned and defaced.

934
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:35,180
Yeah, because there's seven of us
and only one of you.

935
01:13:40,023 --> 01:13:42,596
There's seven of us
and... Eight, nine...

936
01:13:42,775 --> 01:13:44,732
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.

937
01:13:44,944 --> 01:13:47,779
Could you all stop moving
around?! It's so frustrating!

938
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:49,739
I think I counted
one of you twice!

939
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:53,152
While you're at it, count these.

940
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:02,247
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

941
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:07,341
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

942
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,303
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

943
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:22,470
- No.
- Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

944
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:31,820
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

945
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:35,076
- Well, let's get started.
- Testify, sister!

946
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,784
- Charge!
- Charge!

947
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:04,512
<i>Oh, no! He's got
a steel chair.</i>

948
01:15:06,526 --> 01:15:10,226
<i>But he's back
up into a neck-breaker.</i>

949
01:15:10,446 --> 01:15:12,404
<i>He's up to the top rope.</i>

950
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:16,233
<i>- Look at the hang time!
- That's sure gonna leave a dent.</i>

951
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,773
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

952
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:21,990
This is gonna get greasy!

953
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:30,330
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

954
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:47,304
See a need, fill a need!

955
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,596
This isn't
what I was thinking at all.

956
01:18:02,535 --> 01:18:05,204
What are you doing? Get off me.

957
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:09,908
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

958
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:17,377
Ma!

959
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:21,298
My upgrades!

960
01:18:45,078 --> 01:18:48,612
It's all right, son. You can
shine no matter what you...

961
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,625
No! Just stop!

962
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:53,115
Come on, Rodney.

963
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:56,165
Let's open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

964
01:18:56,339 --> 01:19:00,039
Wait a minute. There's one thing
I need to do first.

965
01:19:03,763 --> 01:19:05,174
Herb!

966
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,263
- Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?

967
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,889
- It's Rodney, honey.
- Rodney? Is he all right?

968
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:11,603
Come outside. Hurry.

969
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:13,977
Copperbottom, where
are you going?

970
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:15,808
What about the dishes?

971
01:19:19,153 --> 01:19:20,482
Hey, get back here!

972
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,407
You'll never wash
in this town again.

973
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:29,329
What is all this? The
whole town is out here.

974
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,072
- Rodney?
- Dad!

975
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:35,036
There's someone
I want you to meet.

976
01:19:35,378 --> 01:19:37,501
- Is that...?
- That's Bigweld, Dad...

977
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,878
the greatest robot in the world.

978
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:41,716
Besides you.

979
01:19:41,926 --> 01:19:46,303
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I'm not one to complain.

980
01:19:46,472 --> 01:19:50,933
Well, then don't. I've brought
enough parts to make two of you.

981
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:55,096
Ladies and gentlebots...

982
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:58,025
I came all this way...

983
01:19:58,192 --> 01:20:00,518
Would you cut that out?
It's very distracting.

984
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,189
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

985
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:03,733
Where was I?

986
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:07,525
Mr. And Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

987
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:11,285
to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

988
01:20:11,497 --> 01:20:15,080
<i>the man who got me off my big
titanium tochis...</i>

989
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:20,334
is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

990
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:24,713
Way to go, Rodney!

991
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:29,546
Oh, Mom.

992
01:20:30,808 --> 01:20:32,351
Son.

993
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:36,974
Dad, I know you kind of felt
bad when I was growing up...

994
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:40,066
that you couldn't give
me a lot of stuff.

995
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:42,352
But you gave me
the most important thing:

996
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,444
You believed in me.

997
01:20:44,781 --> 01:20:46,857
From the second you were born.

998
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:50,910
Well, Dad, now I want
your dream to come true.

999
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:54,827
Dad, you always wanted
to be a musician.

1000
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:57,958
Now be one,
for everyone to hear.

1001
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:11,347
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

1002
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:13,100
- Good job!
- Way to go.

1003
01:21:13,309 --> 01:21:16,180
Now I'm sure I've got
a heart, because it's aching.

1004
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:19,353
You'll have to forgive me.

1005
01:21:19,565 --> 01:21:21,938
I'm a little rusty.

1006
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,080
Well, there goes
our happy ending.

1007
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,205
No. It's a fusion
of jazz and funk.

1008
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:42,873
It's called "junk."

1009
01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:59,852
I love you, Herb!

1010
01:23:21,437 --> 01:23:24,723
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.

1011
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:27,355
Sorry.

1012
01:23:32,323 --> 01:23:33,865
I was on the list!

1013
01:23:36,035 --> 01:23:37,909
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
